Using seed = 168652

===== Running Test 1 - Same seed → identical tree =====
[OK] Rules and stats are identical with same seed.
[OK] Test 1 - Same seed → identical tree passed.

===== Running Test 2 - Different seed → different tree =====
[OK] Different seeds produce different tree structure.
[OK] Test 2 - Different seed → different tree passed.

===== Running Test 3 - Stability on repeated calls =====
[OK] Repeated training with same seed is stable.
[OK] Test 3 - Stability on repeated calls passed.

===== Running Test 4 - Stability across 10 datasets =====
[OK] All 10 random datasets produced stable outputs with same seed.
[OK] Test 4 - Stability across 10 datasets passed.

===== Running Test 5 - Full pipeline reproducibility =====
