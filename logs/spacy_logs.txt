 [INFO] A. Completeness / alignment checks
[INFO] Total sentences in sentences_csv: 10000
[INFO] Total unique sentence_id in features_csv: 10000
[INFO] ✓ All sentence ids from sentences_csv are present in features_csv
[INFO] ✓ No extra sentence ids in features_csv
[INFO] ✓ No completely empty rows in features CSV
[INFO] ✓ No empty values in critical feature columns

[INFO] B. Feature-level validation (recomputing via spaCy where needed)

[INFO] Consistency checks for id mappings (pos/dep/ent) ...
[INFO] ✓ POS -> id mapping is consistent (one unique id per label).
[INFO] ✓ Dep label -> id mapping is consistent (one unique id per label).
[INFO] ✓ Ent label -> id mapping is consistent (one unique id per label).

[INFO] Per-token checks using spaCy (token sequence, pos/punct/stop/pronoun/num/depth/children)...

=== RESULTS SUMMARY ===
✓ Token sequence mismatches OK
✓ Numeric issues (is_numeric) OK
✓ Punctuation issues (is_punctuation) OK
✓ Stopword issues (is_stopword) OK
✓ Pronoun issues (is_pronoun) OK
✓ POS mismatches (reported pos vs spaCy pos) OK
✓ Dep-label mismatches (reported dep vs spaCy dep) OK
✓ Ent-label mismatches (reported ent vs spaCy ent) OK
✓ Depth mismatches (depth_in_tree) OK
✓ Children mismatches (num_dependents) OK

=== VERDICT ===
ALL TESTS PASSED — features file appears consistent with spaCy and the sentences file.
