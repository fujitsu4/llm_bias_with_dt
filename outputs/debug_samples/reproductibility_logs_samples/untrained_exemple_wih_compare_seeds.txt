REPRODUCIBILITY TEST
Model: untrained
Layer: 2
Iterations: 5
Sentences: [1, 2714, 4131, 4465]
============================================

>>> TEST 1 : SAME-SEED REPRODUCIBILITY
  Running iteration 1/5
  Running iteration 2/5
  Running iteration 3/5
  Running iteration 4/5
  Running iteration 5/5

>>> RESULTS (same seed/pretrained):

Layer 1:
   Iteration 1 vs 2: REPRODUCIBLE (top-5 identical)
   Iteration 1 vs 3: REPRODUCIBLE (top-5 identical)
   Iteration 1 vs 4: REPRODUCIBLE (top-5 identical)
   Iteration 1 vs 5: REPRODUCIBLE (top-5 identical)

============================================
>>> TEST 2 : DIFFERENT-SEED SENSITIVITY
============================================

  Running seed 2569...
  Running seed 2570...
  Running seed 2571...

>>> RESULTS (different seeds):

Layer 1:
   Seeds 2569 vs 2570: COMPLETELY different top5 (excellent sensitivity)
   Seeds 2570 vs 2571: COMPLETELY different top5 (excellent sensitivity)

Done.
