5085;This new method is generic in the sense that it can be applied to a wide range of machine learning architectures, from deep neural networks to support vector machines for example.;arxiv
5086;These two-scale loss functions allow to focus the training onto objects in the training set which are not well classified.;arxiv

5130;We propose two general and falsifiable hypotheses about expectations on generalization error when learning in the context of concept drift.;arxiv
5131;One posits that as drift rate increases, the forgetting rate that minimizes generalization error will also increase and vice versa.;arxiv
5132;The other posits that as a learner's forgetting rate increases, the bias/variance profile that minimizes generalization error will have lower variance and vice versa.;arxiv
5133;These hypotheses lead to the concept of the sweet path, a path through the 3-d space of alternative drift rates, forgetting rates and bias/variance profiles on which generalization error will be minimized, such that slow drift is coupled with low forgetting and low bias, while rapid drift is coupled with fast forgetting and low variance.;arxiv
5134;We present experiments that support the existence of such a sweet path.;arxiv
5135;We also demonstrate that simple learners that select appropriate forgetting rates and bias/variance profiles are highly competitive with the state-of-the-art in incremental learners for concept drift on real-world drift problems.;arxiv

5144;Our results demonstrate that, while these techniques make incremental improvements on the trade-off on a relative scale, the negative side-effects caused by adversarial training still outweigh the improvements by an order of magnitude.;arxiv
5145;We conclude that more substantial advances in robust learning methods are necessary before they can benefit robot learning tasks in practice.;arxiv
5146;Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to circumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial perturbations.;arxiv
5147;However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored to defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g. $\ell_\infty$-attack).;arxiv
5148;In safety-critical applications, this makes these methods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the system.;arxiv
5149;Moreover, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously significantly increases the computational overhead during training.;arxiv
5150;To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly learns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple types of attacks.;arxiv

5154;Increasing the explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires evaluating whether they implement symbolic computation.;arxiv
5155;One central symbolic capacity is variable binding: linking an input value to an abstract variable held in system-internal memory.;arxiv
5156;Prior work on the computational abilities of DNNs has not resolved the question of whether their internal processes involve variable binding.;arxiv
5157;We argue that the reason for this is fundamental, inherent in the way experiments in prior work were designed.;arxiv
5158;We provide the first systematic evaluation of the variable binding capacities of the state-of-the-art Transformer networks BERT and RoBERTa.;arxiv
5159;Our experiments are designed such that the model must generalize a rule across disjoint subsets of the input vocabulary, and cannot rely on associative pattern matching alone.;arxiv
5160;"These findings indicate that the effectiveness of Transformers in sequence modelling may lie in their extensive use of the input itself as an external ""memory"" rather than network-internal symbolic operations involving variable binding.";arxiv
5161;Therefore, we propose a novel direction for future work: augmenting the inputs available to circumvent the lack of network-internal variable binding.;arxiv

5171;This structure provides outstanding effectiveness and efficiency for small scale upsampling.;arxiv
5172;However, the single-pass upsampling used by UrbanFM is insufficient at higher upscaling rates.;arxiv

5179;With a growing number of voice-based assistants, speech LI has emerged as a widely researched field.;arxiv
5180;To approach the problem of identifying languages, we can either adopt an implicit approach where only the speech for a language is present or an explicit one where text is available with its corresponding transcript.;arxiv

5186;In this paper we develop methods to solve two problems related to time series (TS) analysis using quantum computing: reconstruction and classification.;arxiv
5187;We formulate the task of reconstructing a given TS from a training set of data as an unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be solved by both quantum annealers and gate-model quantum processors.;arxiv
5188;We accomplish this by discretizing the TS and converting the reconstruction to a set cover problem, allowing us to perform a one-versus-all method of reconstruction.;arxiv
5189;Using the solution to the reconstruction problem, we show how to extend this method to perform semi-supervised classification of TS data.;arxiv
5190;We present results indicating our method is competitive with current semi- and unsupervised classification techniques, but using less data than classical techniques.;arxiv
5191;We consider the problem of joint source and channel coding of structured data such as natural language over a noisy channel.;arxiv
5192;The typical approach to this problem in both theory and practice involves performing source coding to first compress the text and then channel coding to add robustness for the transmission across the channel.;arxiv
5193;This approach is optimal in terms of minimizing end-to-end distortion with arbitrarily large block lengths of both the source and channel codes when transmission is over discrete memoryless channels.;arxiv
5194;However, the optimality of this approach is no longer ensured for documents of finite length and limitations on the length of the encoding.;arxiv
5195;We will show in this scenario that we can achieve lower word error rates by developing a deep learning based encoder and decoder.;arxiv
5196;While the approach of separate source and channel coding would minimize bit error rates, our approach preserves semantic information of sentences by first embedding sentences in a semantic space where sentences closer in meaning are located closer together, and then performing joint source and channel coding on these embeddings.;arxiv

5198;The main contribution of this work is evaluating different data augmentation methods during the training of NMT models.;arxiv
5199;I propose 5 different augmentation methods that are structure-aware, meaning that instead of randomly selecting words for blanking or replacement, the dependency tree of sentences is used as a basis for augmentation.;arxiv
5200;I start my thesis with a detailed literature review on neural networks, sequential modeling, neural machine translation, dependency parsing and data augmentation.;arxiv
5201;After a detailed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of the Hunglish2 corpus, I perform experiments with the proposed data augmentation techniques.;arxiv
5202;The best model for Hungarian-English achieves a BLEU score of 33.9, while the best model for English-Hungarian achieves a BLEU score of 28.6.;arxiv
5203;Integer quantization of neural networks can be defined as the approximation of the high precision computation of the canonical neural network formulation, using reduced integer precision.;arxiv
5204;It plays a significant role in the efficient deployment and execution of machine learning (ML) systems, reducing memory consumption and leveraging typically faster computations.;arxiv
5205;In this work, we present an integer-only quantization strategy for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network topologies, which themselves are the foundation of many production ML systems.;arxiv
5206;Our quantization strategy is accurate (e.g. works well with quantization post-training), efficient and fast to execute (utilizing 8 bit integer weights and mostly 8 bit activations), and is able to target a variety of hardware (by leveraging instructions sets available in common CPU architectures, as well as available neural accelerators).;arxiv
5207;Automated design synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the modern engineering design process and improve access to highly optimized and customized products across countless industries.;arxiv
5208;Successfully adapting generative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance.;arxiv
5209;We present a review and analysis of Deep Generative Machine Learning models in engineering design.;arxiv
5210;Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn from an input dataset and synthesize new designs.;arxiv
5211;Recently, DGMs such as feedforward Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis.;arxiv
5212;The prevalence of DGMs in engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016.;arxiv
5213;Anticipating continued growth, we conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in DGMs for design.;arxiv
5214;We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms, datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current literature.;arxiv
5215;In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or auxiliary methods.;arxiv
5216;We further identify key challenges and limitations currently seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance simultaneously.;arxiv
5217;In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as key areas on which to target future work.;arxiv
5218;Despite excellent performance on many tasks, NLP systems are easily fooled by small adversarial perturbations of inputs.;arxiv
5219;Existing procedures to defend against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT.;arxiv
5220;In this work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture.;arxiv
5221;The core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a smaller, discrete space of encodings.;arxiv
5222;Systems using these encodings as a bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same encodings can be used across multiple tasks.;arxiv
5223;We identify two desiderata to construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still perform well (fidelity).;arxiv
5224;We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family of adversarial typos.;arxiv
5225;Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.;arxiv
5226;The work discussed and presented in this paper focuses on the history matching of reservoirs by integrating 4D seismic data into the inversion process using machine learning techniques.;arxiv
5227;A new integrated scheme for the reconstruction of petrophysical properties with a modified Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) in a synthetic reservoir is proposed.;arxiv
5228;The permeability field inside the reservoir is parametrised with an unsupervised learning approach, namely K-means with Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD).;arxiv
5229;This is combined with the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) technique which is very typical for sparsity promoting regularisation schemes.;arxiv
5230;Moreover, seismic attributes, in particular, acoustic impedance, are parametrised with the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).;arxiv
5231;This novel combination of techniques from machine learning, sparsity regularisation, seismic imaging and history matching aims to address the ill-posedness of the inversion of historical production data efficiently using ES-MDA.;arxiv
5232;In the numerical experiments provided, I demonstrate that these sparse representations of the petrophysical properties and the seismic attributes enables to obtain better production data matches to the true production data and to quantify the propagating waterfront better compared to more traditional methods that do not use comparable parametrisation techniques.;arxiv
5233;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an exciting new field which promises to be as much as a game-changer as Convolutional Neural Networks were in 2012.;arxiv
5234;Despite many great works leading to substantial improvements on a variety of tasks, comparison between different methods is still very much an open issue.;arxiv
5235;While most algorithms are tested on the same datasets, there is no shared experimental protocol followed by all.;arxiv
5236;As such, and due to the under-use of ablation studies, there is a lack of clarity regarding why certain methods are more effective than others.;arxiv
5237;Our first contribution is a benchmark of $8$ NAS methods on $5$ datasets.;arxiv
5238;To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with different search spaces, we propose using a method's relative improvement over the randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages arising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols.;arxiv
5239;Surprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat the average architecture baseline.;arxiv
5240;We perform further experiments with the commonly used DARTS search space in order to understand the contribution of each component in the NAS pipeline.;arxiv
5241;To conclude, we suggest best practices, that we hope will prove useful for the community and help mitigate current NAS pitfalls.;arxiv
5242;While sample sizes in randomized clinical trials are large enough to estimate the average treatment effect well, they are often insufficient for estimation of treatment-covariate interactions critical to studying data-driven precision medicine.;arxiv
5243;Observational data from real world practice may play an important role in alleviating this problem.;arxiv
5244;One common approach in trials is to predict the outcome of interest with separate regression models in each treatment arm, and estimate the treatment effect based on the contrast of the predictions.;arxiv
5245;Unfortunately, this simple approach may induce spurious treatment-covariate interaction in observational studies when the regression model is misspecified.;arxiv
5246;Motivated by the need of modeling the number of relapses in multiple sclerosis patients, where the ratio of relapse rates is a natural choice of the treatment effect, we propose to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as the ratio of expected potential outcomes, and derive a doubly robust estimator of this CATE in a semiparametric model of treatment-covariate interactions.;arxiv
5247;We also provide a validation procedure to check the quality of the estimator on an independent sample.;arxiv
5248;We conduct simulations to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods, and illustrate their advantages on real data by examining the treatment effect of dimethyl fumarate compared to teriflunomide in multiple sclerosis patients.;arxiv
5249;Code Smell, similar to a bad smell, is a surface indication of something tainted but in terms of software writing practices.;arxiv
5250;This metric is an indication of a deeper problem lies within the code and is associated with an issue which is prominent to experienced software developers with acceptable coding practices.;arxiv
5251;Recent studies have often observed that codes having code smells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software development cycle.;arxiv
5252;In this paper, we developed code smell prediction models with the help of features extracted from source code to predict eight types of code smell.;arxiv
5253;Our work also presents the application of data sampling techniques to handle class imbalance problem and feature selection techniques to find relevant feature sets.;arxiv
5254;Previous studies had made use of techniques such as Naive - Bayes and Random forest but had not explored deep learning methods to predict code smell.;arxiv
5255;A total of 576 distinct Deep Learning models were trained using the features and datasets mentioned above.;arxiv
5256;The study concluded that the deep learning models which used data from Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique gave better results in terms of accuracy, AUC with the accuracy of some models improving from 88.47 to 96.84.;arxiv
5257;We consider $Q$-learning with knowledge transfer, using samples from a target reinforcement learning (RL) task as well as source samples from different but related RL tasks.;arxiv
5258;We propose transfer learning algorithms for both batch and online $Q$-learning with offline source studies.;arxiv
5259;The proposed transferred $Q$-learning algorithm contains a novel re-targeting step that enables vertical information-cascading along multiple steps in an RL task, besides the usual horizontal information-gathering as transfer learning (TL) for supervised learning.;arxiv
5260;We establish the first theoretical justifications of TL in RL tasks by showing a faster rate of convergence of the $Q$ function estimation in the offline RL transfer, and a lower regret bound in the offline-to-online RL transfer under certain similarity assumptions.;arxiv
5261;Empirical evidences from both synthetic and real datasets are presented to back up the proposed algorithm and our theoretical results.;arxiv
5262;Through the quantification of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), health care monitoring has the potential to stimulate vital and healthy ageing, inducing behavioural changes in older people and linking these to personal health gains.;arxiv
5263;To be able to measure PAEE in a monitoring environment, methods from wearable accelerometers have been developed, however, mainly targeted towards younger people.;arxiv
5264;Since elderly subjects differ in energy requirements and range of physical activities, the current models may not be suitable for estimating PAEE among the elderly.;arxiv
5265;Because past activities influence present PAEE, we propose a modeling approach known for its ability to model sequential data, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).;arxiv
5266;To train the RNN for an elderly population, we used the GOTOV dataset with 34 healthy participants of 60 years and older (mean 65 years old), performing 16 different activities.;arxiv
5267;We used accelerometers placed on wrist and ankle, and measurements of energy counts by means of indirect calorimetry.;arxiv
5268;After optimization, we propose an architecture consisting of an RNN with 3 GRU layers and a feedforward network combining both accelerometer and participant-level data.;arxiv
5269;In this paper, we describe our efforts to go beyond the standard facilities of a GRU-based RNN, with the aim of achieving accuracy surpassing the state of the art.;arxiv
5270;These efforts include switching aggregation function from mean to dispersion measures (SD, IQR, ...), combining temporal and static data (person-specific details such as age, weight, BMI) and adding symbolic activity data as predicted by a previously trained ML model.;arxiv
5271;The resulting architecture manages to increase its performance by approximatelly 10% while decreasing training input by a factor of 10.;arxiv
5272;It can thus be employed to investigate associations of PAEE with vitality parameters related to metabolic and cognitive health and mental well-being.;arxiv
5273;Symmetry transformations induce invariances which are frequently described with deep latent variable models.;arxiv
5274;In many complex domains, such as the chemical space, invariances can be observed, yet the corresponding symmetry transformation cannot be formulated analytically.;arxiv
5275;We propose to learn the symmetry transformation with a model consisting of two latent subspaces, where the first subspace captures the target and the second subspace the remaining invariant information.;arxiv
5276;Our approach is based on the deep information bottleneck in combination with a continuous mutual information regulariser.;arxiv
5277;Unlike previous methods, we focus on the challenging task of minimising mutual information in continuous domains.;arxiv
5278;To this end, we base the calculation of mutual information on correlation matrices in combination with a bijective variable transformation.;arxiv
5279;Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on artificial and molecular datasets.;arxiv
5280;Gaussian processes have become a promising tool for various safety-critical settings, since the posterior variance can be used to directly estimate the model error and quantify risk.;arxiv
5281;However, state-of-the-art techniques for safety-critical settings hinge on the assumption that the kernel hyperparameters are known, which does not apply in general.;arxiv
5282;To mitigate this, we introduce robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds in settings with unknown hyperparameters.;arxiv
5283;Our approach computes a confidence region in the space of hyperparameters, which enables us to obtain a probabilistic upper bound for the model error of a Gaussian process with arbitrary hyperparameters.;arxiv
5284;Instead, we are able to derive bounds from data in an intuitive fashion.;arxiv
5285;We additionally employ the proposed technique to derive performance guarantees for a class of learning-based control problems.;arxiv
5286;Experiments show that the bound performs significantly better than vanilla and fully Bayesian Gaussian processes.;arxiv
5287;We present the first learning-based visual odometry (VO) model, which generalizes to multiple datasets and real-world scenarios and outperforms geometry-based methods in challenging scenes.;arxiv
5288;We achieve this by leveraging the SLAM dataset TartanAir, which provides a large amount of diverse synthetic data in challenging environments.;arxiv
5289;Furthermore, to make our VO model generalize across datasets, we propose an up-to-scale loss function and incorporate the camera intrinsic parameters into the model.;arxiv
5290;Experiments show that a single model, TartanVO, trained only on synthetic data, without any finetuning, can be generalized to real-world datasets such as KITTI and EuRoC, demonstrating significant advantages over the geometry-based methods on challenging trajectories.;arxiv
5291;We consider online sequential decision problems where an agent must balance exploration and exploitation.;arxiv
5292;We provide a new analysis showing that any algorithm producing policies in the optimistic set enjoys $\tilde O(\sqrt{AT})$ Bayesian regret for a problem with $A$ actions after $T$ rounds.;arxiv
5293;We extend the regret analysis for optimistic policies to bilinear saddle-point problems which include zero-sum matrix games and constrained bandits as special cases.;arxiv
5294;In this case we show that Thompson sampling can produce policies outside of the optimistic set and suffer linear regret in some instances.;arxiv
5295;The procedure works for any posteriors, \ie, it does not require the posterior to have any special properties, such as log-concavity, unimodality, or smoothness.;arxiv
5296;The variational view of the problem has many useful properties, including the ability to tune the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, add regularization, incorporate constraints, and linearly parameterize the policy.;arxiv
5297;Current deep learning architectures show remarkable performance when trained in large-scale, controlled datasets.;arxiv
5298;However, the predictive ability of these architectures significantly decreases when learning new classes incrementally.;arxiv
5299;This is due to their inclination to forget the knowledge acquired from previously seen data, a phenomenon termed catastrophic-forgetting.;arxiv
5300;On the other hand, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can model the input space utilizing constrained k-means and thus maintain past knowledge.;arxiv
5301;Here, we propose a novel algorithm inspired by biological neurons, termed Dendritic-Self-Organizing Map (DendSOM).;arxiv
5302;DendSOM consists of a single layer of SOMs, which extract patterns from specific regions of the input space accompanied by a set of hit matrices, one per SOM, which estimate the association between units and labels.;arxiv
5303;The best-matching unit of an input pattern is selected using the maximum cosine similarity rule, while the point-wise mutual information is employed for class inference.;arxiv
5304;DendSOM performs unsupervised feature extraction as it does not use labels for targeted updating of the weights.;arxiv
5305;It outperforms classical SOMs and several state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms on benchmark datasets, such as the Split-MNIST and Split-CIFAR-10.;arxiv
5306;We propose that the incorporation of neuronal properties in SOMs may help remedy catastrophic forgetting.;arxiv
5307;This work studies the denoising of piecewise smooth graph signals that exhibit inhomogeneous levels of smoothness over a graph, where the value at each node can be vector-valued.;arxiv
5308;We extend the graph trend filtering framework to denoising vector-valued graph signals with a family of non-convex regularizers, which exhibit superior recovery performance over existing convex regularizers.;arxiv
5309;Using an oracle inequality, we establish the statistical error rates of first-order stationary points of the proposed non-convex method for generic graphs.;arxiv
5310;Furthermore, we present an ADMM-based algorithm to solve the proposed method and establish its convergence.;arxiv
5311;Numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world data for denoising, support recovery, event detection, and semi-supervised classification.;arxiv
5312;In this work, we propose DiffWave, a versatile diffusion probabilistic model for conditional and unconditional waveform generation.;arxiv
5313;The model is non-autoregressive, and converts the white noise signal into structured waveform through a Markov chain with a constant number of steps at synthesis.;arxiv
5314;It is efficiently trained by optimizing a variant of variational bound on the data likelihood.;arxiv
5315;DiffWave produces high-fidelity audios in different waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation.;arxiv
5316;We demonstrate that DiffWave matches a strong WaveNet vocoder in terms of speech quality (MOS: 4.44 versus 4.43), while synthesizing orders of magnitude faster.;arxiv
5317;In particular, it significantly outperforms autoregressive and GAN-based waveform models in the challenging unconditional generation task in terms of audio quality and sample diversity from various automatic and human evaluations.;arxiv
5318;Due to the ease of modern data collection, applied statisticians often have access to a large set of covariates that they wish to relate to some observed outcome.;arxiv
5319;Generalized linear models (GLMs) offer a particularly interpretable framework for such an analysis.;arxiv
5320;Unfortunately, existing methods for Bayesian inference in GLMs require running times roughly cubic in parameter dimension, and so are limited to settings with at most tens of thousand parameters.;arxiv
5321;We propose to reduce time and memory costs with a low-rank approximation of the data in an approach we call LR-GLM.;arxiv
5322;When used with the Laplace approximation or Markov chain Monte Carlo, LR-GLM provides a full Bayesian posterior approximation and admits running times reduced by a full factor of the parameter dimension.;arxiv
5323;We rigorously establish the quality of our approximation and show how the choice of rank allows a tunable computational-statistical trade-off.;arxiv
5324;Experiments support our theory and demonstrate the efficacy of LR-GLM on real large-scale datasets.;arxiv
5325;Fairness in machine learning (ML), the process to understand and correct algorithmic bias, has gained increasing attention with numerous literature being carried out, commonly assume the underlying data is independent and identically distributed (IID).;arxiv
5326;On the other hand, graphs are a ubiquitous data structure to capture connections among individual units and is non-IID by nature.;arxiv
5327;It is therefore of great importance to bridge the traditional fairness literature designed on IID data and ubiquitous non-IID graph representations to tackle bias in ML systems.;arxiv
5328;In this survey, we review such recent advance in fairness amidst non-IID graph data and identify datasets and evaluation metrics available for future research.;arxiv
5329;We also point out the limitations of existing work as well as promising future directions.;arxiv
5330;When designing variational autoencoders (VAEs) or other types of latent space models, the dimensionality of the latent space is typically defined upfront.;arxiv
5331;In this process, it is possible that the number of dimensions is under- or overprovisioned for the application at hand.;arxiv
5332;In case the dimensionality is not predefined, this parameter is usually determined using time- and resource-consuming cross-validation.;arxiv
5333;For these reasons we have developed a technique to shrink the latent space dimensionality of VAEs automatically and on-the-fly during training using Generalized ELBO with Constrained Optimization (GECO) and the $L_0$-Augment-REINFORCE-Merge ($L_0$-ARM) gradient estimator.;arxiv
5334;The GECO optimizer ensures that we are not violating a predefined upper bound on the reconstruction error.;arxiv
5335;This paper presents the algorithmic details of our method along with experimental results on five different datasets.;arxiv
5336;We find that our training procedure is stable and that the latent space can be pruned effectively without violating the GECO constraints.;arxiv

5338;Introduces JigsawHSI (based on Jigsaw) and uses it on the land-use land-cover (LULC) classification problem with the Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas hyperspectral image data sets.;arxiv
5339;The network is compared against HybridSN, a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by 2D-CNN that achieves state-of-the-art results on the datasets.;arxiv
5340;This short article proves that JigsawHSI is able to meet or exceed HybridSN's performance in all three cases.;arxiv
5341;Additionally, the use of jigsaw in geosciences is highlighted, while the code and toolkit are made available.;arxiv
5342;We investigate optimal posteriors for recently introduced \cite{begin2016pac} chi-squared divergence based PAC-Bayesian bounds in terms of nature of their distribution, scalability of computations, and test set performance.;arxiv
5343;For a finite classifier set, we deduce bounds for three distance functions: KL-divergence, linear and squared distances.;arxiv
5344;Optimal posterior weights are proportional to deviations of empirical risks, usually with subset support.;arxiv
5345;For uniform prior, it is sufficient to search among posteriors on classifier subsets ordered by these risks.;arxiv
5346;We show the bound minimization for linear distance as a convex program and obtain a closed-form expression for its optimal posterior.;arxiv
5347;Whereas that for squared distance is a quasi-convex program under a specific condition, and the one for KL-divergence is non-convex optimization (a difference of convex functions).;arxiv
5348;To compute such optimal posteriors, we derive fast converging fixed point (FP) equations.;arxiv
5349;We apply these approaches to a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values to yield stochastic SVMs with tight bounds.;arxiv
5350;Chi-squared divergence based posteriors have weaker bounds and worse test errors, hinting at an underlying regularization by KL-divergence based posteriors.;arxiv
5351;Our study highlights the impact of divergence function on the performance of PAC-Bayesian classifiers.;arxiv
5352;We compare our stochastic classifiers with cross-validation based deterministic classifier.;arxiv
5353;The latter has better test errors, but ours is more sample robust, has quantifiable generalization guarantees, and is computationally much faster.;arxiv
5354;Due to the insufficient measurements in the distribution system state estimation (DSSE), full observability and redundant measurements are difficult to achieve without using the pseudo measurements.;arxiv
5355;The matrix completion state estimation (MCSE) combines the matrix completion and power system model to estimate voltage by exploring the low-rank characteristics of the matrix.;arxiv
5356;This paper proposes a robust matrix completion state estimation (RMCSE) to estimate the voltage in a distribution system under a low-observability condition.;arxiv
5357;Tradition state estimation weighted least squares (WLS) method requires full observability to calculate the states and needs redundant measurements to proceed a bad data detection.;arxiv
5358;The proposed method improves the robustness of the MCSE to bad data by minimizing the rank of the matrix and measurements residual with different weights.;arxiv
5359;It can estimate the system state in a low-observability system and has robust estimates without the bad data detection process in the face of multiple bad data.;arxiv
5360;The method is numerically evaluated on the IEEE 33-node radial distribution system.;arxiv
5361;The estimation performance and robustness of RMCSE are compared with the WLS with the largest normalized residual bad data identification (WLS-LNR), and the MCSE.;arxiv
5362;This paper proposes a representational model for image pairs such as consecutive video frames that are related by local pixel displacements, in the hope that the model may shed light on motion perception in primary visual cortex (V1).;arxiv
5363;When the image frame undergoes changes due to local pixel displacements, the vectors are multiplied by the matrices that represent the local displacements.;arxiv
5364;Thus the vector representation is equivariant as it varies according to the local displacements.;arxiv
5365;Our experiments show that our model can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases.;arxiv
5366;The profiles of the learned filters match those of simple cells in Macaque V1.;arxiv
5367;Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can learn to infer local motions in either a supervised or unsupervised manner.;arxiv
5368;With such a simple model, we achieve competitive results on optical flow estimation.;arxiv
5369;Energy-based modeling is a promising approach to unsupervised learning, which yields many downstream applications from a single model.;arxiv
5370;"The main difficulty in learning energy-based models with the ""contrastive approaches"" is the generation of samples from the current energy function at each iteration.";arxiv
5371;Many advances have been made to accomplish this subroutine cheaply.;arxiv
5372;Nevertheless, all such sampling paradigms run MCMC targeting the current model, which requires infinitely long chains to generate samples from the true energy distribution and is problematic in practice.;arxiv
5373;This paper proposes an alternative approach to getting these samples and avoiding crude MCMC sampling from the current model.;arxiv
5374;We accomplish this by viewing the evolution of the modeling distribution as (i) the evolution of the energy function, and (ii) the evolution of the samples from this distribution along some vector field.;arxiv
5375;We subsequently derive this time-dependent vector field such that the particles following this field are approximately distributed as the current density model.;arxiv
5376;Thereby we match the evolution of the particles with the evolution of the energy function prescribed by the learning procedure.;arxiv
5377;Importantly, unlike Monte Carlo sampling, our method targets to match the current distribution in a finite time.;arxiv
5378;Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness empirically compared to MCMC-based learning methods.;arxiv
5379;Optimal decision-making in social settings is often based on forecasts from time series (TS) data.;arxiv
5380;Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS forecasting and have shown promising results.;arxiv
5381;However, the applicability of these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors.;arxiv
5382;Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult.;arxiv
5383;In this work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations.;arxiv
5384;To this end, we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate autoregressive model.;arxiv
5385;We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism (ACTM) to address it.;arxiv
5386;With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability distributions than with previous approaches.;arxiv
5387;Using this mechanism, we propose a self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns and takes advantage of the relationships between them.;arxiv
5388;We test our model on two datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities.;arxiv
5389;Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory.;arxiv
5390;We point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.;arxiv
5391;The majority of online reviews consist of plain-text feedback together with a single numeric score.;arxiv
5392;For example, a user's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products.;arxiv
5393;In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product.;arxiv
5394;By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we use our model to uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects.;arxiv
5395;Second, we use our model to summarize reviews, which for us means finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating.;arxiv
5396;Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we use our model to recover those ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation.;arxiv

5406;The recognition network in deep latent variable models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) relies on amortized inference for efficient posterior approximation that can scale up to large datasets.;arxiv
5407;However, this technique has also been demonstrated to select suboptimal variational parameters, often resulting in considerable additional error called the amortization gap.;arxiv
5408;To close the amortization gap and improve the training of the generative model, recent works have introduced an additional refinement step that applies stochastic variational inference (SVI) to improve upon the variational parameters returned by the amortized inference model.;arxiv

5445;A saliency metric estimates which parameters can be safely pruned with little impact on the classification performance of the DNN.;arxiv
5446;Many saliency metrics have been proposed, each within the context of a wider pruning algorithm.;arxiv
5447;The result is that it is difficult to separate the effectiveness of the saliency metric from the wider pruning algorithm that surrounds it.;arxiv
5448;Similar-looking saliency metrics can yield very different results because of apparently minor design choices.;arxiv
5449;We propose a taxonomy of saliency metrics based on four mostly-orthogonal principal components.;arxiv
5450;We show that a broad range of metrics from the pruning literature can be grouped according to these components.;arxiv
5451;Our taxonomy not only serves as a guide to prior work, but allows us to construct new saliency metrics by exploring novel combinations of our taxonomic components.;arxiv
5452;We perform an in-depth experimental investigation of more than 300 saliency metrics.;arxiv
5453;Our results provide decisive answers to open research questions, and demonstrate the importance of reduction and scaling when pruning groups of weights.;arxiv

5459;Estimating predictive uncertainty is crucial for many computer vision tasks, from image classification to autonomous driving systems.;arxiv
5460;Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an sampling method for performing Bayesian inference.;arxiv
5461;On the other hand, Dropout regularization has been proposed as an approximate model averaging technique that tends to improve generalization in large scale models such as deep neural networks.;arxiv
5462;Although, HMC provides convergence guarantees for most standard Bayesian models, it does not handle discrete parameters arising from Dropout regularization.;arxiv
5463;In this paper, we present a robust methodology for improving predictive uncertainty in classification problems, based on Dropout and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.;arxiv
5464;Even though Dropout induces a non-smooth energy function with no such convergence guarantees, the resulting discretization of the Hamiltonian proves empirical success.;arxiv

5468;Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of CNNs and RNNs by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but spatial data sparsity and limited learning capabilities on temporal long-term dependencies are still two striking bottlenecks.;arxiv
5469;To address these limitations, we propose a new virtual graph modeling method to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatiotemporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and temporal long-term dependencies.;arxiv

5473;High-quality education is one of the keys to achieving a more sustainable world.;arxiv
5474;The recent COVID-19 epidemic has triggered the outbreak of online education, which has enabled both students and teachers to learn and teach at home.;arxiv
5475;Meanwhile, it is now possible to record and research a large amount of learning data using online learning platforms in order to offer better intelligent educational services.;arxiv
5476;Knowledge Tracing (KT), which aims to monitor students' evolving knowledge state, is a fundamental and crucial task to support these intelligent services.;arxiv
5477;Therefore, an increasing amount of research attention has been paid to this emerging area and considerable progress has been made.;arxiv
5478;In this survey, we propose a new taxonomy of existing basic KT models from a technical perspective and provide a comprehensive overview of these models in a systematic manner.;arxiv
5479;In addition, many variants of KT models have been proposed to capture more complete learning process.;arxiv
5480;We then review these variants involved in three phases of the learning process: before, during, and after the student learning, respectively.;arxiv
5481;Moreover, we present several typical applications of KT in different educational scenarios.;arxiv
5482;Finally, we provide some potential directions for future research in this fast-growing field.;arxiv
5483;Formation mechanisms are fundamental to the study of complex networks, but learning them from observations is challenging.;arxiv
5484;In real-world domains, one often has access only to the final constructed graph, instead of the full construction process, and observed graphs exhibit complex structural properties.;arxiv
5485;In this work, we propose GraphOpt, an end-to-end framework that jointly learns an implicit model of graph structure formation and discovers an underlying optimization mechanism in the form of a latent objective function.;arxiv
5486;The learned objective can serve as an explanation for the observed graph properties, thereby lending itself to transfer across different graphs within a domain.;arxiv
5487;GraphOpt poses link formation in graphs as a sequential decision-making process and solves it using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm.;arxiv
5488;Further, it employs a novel continuous latent action space that aids scalability.;arxiv
5489;Empirically, we demonstrate that GraphOpt discovers a latent objective transferable across graphs with different characteristics.;arxiv
5490;GraphOpt also learns a robust stochastic policy that achieves competitive link prediction performance without being explicitly trained on this task and further enables construction of graphs with properties similar to those of the observed graph.;arxiv
5491;Despite their recent success on image denoising, the need for deep and complex architectures still hinders the practical usage of CNNs.;arxiv
5492;Older but computationally more efficient methods such as BM3D remain a popular choice, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.;arxiv
5493;In this study, we aim to find out whether compact neural networks can learn to produce competitive results as compared to BM3D for AWGN image denoising.;arxiv
5494;To this end, we configure networks with only two hidden layers and employ different neuron models and layer widths for comparing the performance with BM3D across different AWGN noise levels.;arxiv
5495;Our results conclusively show that the recently proposed self-organized variant of operational neural networks based on a generative neuron model (Self-ONNs) is not only a better choice as compared to CNNs, but also provide competitive results as compared to BM3D and even significantly surpass it for high noise levels.;arxiv
5496;For an autonomous agent, executing a poor policy may be costly or even dangerous.;arxiv
5497;For such agents, it is desirable to determine confidence interval lower bounds on the performance of any given policy without executing said policy.;arxiv
5498;Current methods for exact high confidence off-policy evaluation that use importance sampling require a substantial amount of data to achieve a tight lower bound.;arxiv
5499;Existing model-based methods only address the problem in discrete state spaces.;arxiv
5500;Since exact bounds are intractable for many domains we trade off strict guarantees of safety for more data-efficient approximate bounds.;arxiv
5501;In this context, we propose two bootstrapping off-policy evaluation methods which use learned MDP transition models in order to estimate lower confidence bounds on policy performance with limited data in both continuous and discrete state spaces.;arxiv
5502;Since direct use of a model may introduce bias, we derive a theoretical upper bound on model bias for when the model transition function is estimated with i.i.d. trajectories.;arxiv
5503;This bound broadens our understanding of the conditions under which model-based methods have high bias.;arxiv
5504;Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed methods and analyze the settings in which different bootstrapping off-policy confidence interval methods succeed and fail.;arxiv
5505;Delineating the associations between images and a vector of covariates is of central interest in medical imaging studies.;arxiv
5506;To tackle this problem of image response regression, we propose a novel nonparametric approach in the framework of spatially varying coefficient models, where the spatially varying functions are estimated through deep neural networks.;arxiv
5507;Compared to existing solutions, the proposed method explicitly accounts for spatial smoothness and subject heterogeneity, has straightforward interpretations, and is highly flexible and accurate in capturing complex association patterns.;arxiv
5508;A key idea in our approach is to treat the image voxels as the effective samples, which not only alleviates the limited sample size issue that haunts the majority of medical imaging studies, but also leads to more robust and reproducible results.;arxiv
5509;Focusing on a broad family of piecewise smooth functions, we establish the estimation and selection consistency, and derive the asymptotic error bounds.;arxiv

5514;Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy.;arxiv
5515;Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.;arxiv
5516;In 2021 the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory held an internal challenge to develop artificially intelligent (AI) agents that could excel at the collaborative card game Hanabi.;arxiv
5517;Agents were evaluated on their ability to play with human players whom the agents had never previously encountered.;arxiv
5518;This study details the development of the agent that won the challenge by achieving a human-play average score of 16.5, outperforming the current state-of-the-art for human-bot Hanabi scores.;arxiv
5519;The winning agent's development consisted of observing and accurately modeling the author's decision making in Hanabi, then training with a behavioral clone of the author.;arxiv
5520;Notably, the agent discovered a human-complementary play style by first mimicking human decision making, then exploring variations to the human-like strategy that led to higher simulated human-bot scores.;arxiv
5521;This work examines in detail the design and implementation of this human compatible Hanabi teammate, as well as the existence and implications of human-complementary strategies and how they may be explored for more successful applications of AI in human machine teams.;arxiv
5522;We propose Bayesian extensions of two nonparametric regression methods which are kernel and mutual $k$-nearest neighbor regression methods.;arxiv
5523;Derived based on Gaussian process models for regression, the extensions provide distributions for target value estimates and the framework to select the hyperparameters.;arxiv
5524;It is shown that both the proposed methods asymptotically converge to kernel and mutual $k$-nearest neighbor regression methods, respectively.;arxiv
5525;The simulation results show that the proposed methods can select proper hyperparameters and are better than or comparable to the former methods for an artificial data set and a real world data set.;arxiv
5526;Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit great success on many tasks with the help of large-scale well annotated datasets.;arxiv
5527;Training on these noisy labeled datasets may adversely deteriorate their generalization performance.;arxiv
5528;Existing methods either rely on complex training stage division or bring too much computation for marginal performance improvement.;arxiv
5529;In this paper, we propose a Temporal Calibrated Regularization (TCR), in which we utilize the original labels and the predictions in the previous epoch together to make DNN inherit the simple pattern it has learned with little overhead.;arxiv
5530;We conduct extensive experiments on various neural network architectures and datasets, and find that it consistently enhances the robustness of DNNs to label noise.;arxiv
5531;We introduce the binacox, a prognostic method to deal with the problem of detecting multiple cut-points per features in a multivariate setting where a large number of continuous features are available.;arxiv
5532;The method is based on the Cox model and combines one-hot encoding with the binarsity penalty, which uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint, and enables feature selection.;arxiv
5533;Original nonasymptotic oracle inequalities for prediction (in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence) and estimation with a fast rate of convergence are established.;arxiv
5534;The statistical performance of the method is examined in an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and then illustrated on three publicly available genetic cancer datasets.;arxiv
5535;On these high-dimensional datasets, our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art survival models regarding risk prediction in terms of the C-index, with a computing time orders of magnitude faster.;arxiv
5536;In addition, it provides powerful interpretability from a clinical perspective by automatically pinpointing significant cut-points in relevant variables.;arxiv
5537;"Recent work on fairness in machine learning has primarily emphasized how to define, quantify, and encourage ""fair"" outcomes.";arxiv
5538;Less attention has been paid, however, to the ethical foundations which underlie such efforts.;arxiv
5539;Among the ethical perspectives that should be taken into consideration is consequentialism, the position that, roughly speaking, outcomes are all that matter.;arxiv
5540;Although consequentialism is not free from difficulties, and although it does not necessarily provide a tractable way of choosing actions (because of the combined problems of uncertainty, subjectivity, and aggregation), it nevertheless provides a powerful foundation from which to critique the existing literature on machine learning fairness.;arxiv
5541;Moreover, it brings to the fore some of the tradeoffs involved, including the problem of who counts, the pros and cons of using a policy, and the relative value of the distant future.;arxiv
5542;In this paper we provide a consequentialist critique of common definitions of fairness within machine learning, as well as a machine learning perspective on consequentialism.;arxiv
5543;We conclude with a broader discussion of the issues of learning and randomization, which have important implications for the ethics of automated decision making systems.;arxiv
5544;Large scale recommender models find most relevant items from huge catalogs, and they play a critical role in modern search and recommendation systems.;arxiv
5545;To model the input space with large-vocab categorical features, a typical recommender model learns a joint embedding space through neural networks for both queries and items from user feedback data.;arxiv
5546;However, with millions to billions of items in the corpus, users tend to provide feedback for a very small set of them, causing a power-law distribution.;arxiv
5547;This makes the feedback data for long-tail items extremely sparse.;arxiv
5548;Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised representation learning research in both computer vision and natural language understanding, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for large-scale item recommendations.;arxiv
5549;The framework is designed to tackle the label sparsity problem by learning better latent relationship of item features.;arxiv
5550;Specifically, SSL improves item representation learning as well as serving as additional regularization to improve generalization.;arxiv
5551;Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation method that utilizes feature correlations within the proposed framework.;arxiv
5552;We evaluate our framework using two real-world datasets with 500M and 1B training examples respectively.;arxiv
5553;Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSL regularization and show its superior performance over the state-of-the-art regularization techniques.;arxiv
5554;We also have already launched the proposed techniques to a web-scale commercial app-to-app recommendation system, with significant improvements top-tier business metrics demonstrated in A/B experiments on live traffic.;arxiv
5555;Our online results also verify our hypothesis that our framework indeed improves model performance even more on slices that lack supervision.;arxiv
5556;Both efficient neural networks and hardware accelerators are being explored to speed up DNN inference on edge devices.;arxiv
5557;For example, MobileNet uses depthwise separable convolution to achieve much lower latency, while systolic arrays provide much higher performance per watt.;arxiv
5558;Interestingly however, the combination of these two ideas is inefficient: The computational patterns of depth-wise separable convolution are not systolic and lack data reuse to saturate the systolic array's constrained dataflow.;arxiv
5559;In this paper, we propose FuSeConv (Fully-Separable Convolution) as a drop-in replacement for depth-wise separable convolution.;arxiv
5560;FuSeConv generalizes the decomposition of convolutions fully to separable 1D convolutions along spatial and depth dimensions.;arxiv
5561;The resultant computation is systolic and efficiently utilizes the systolic array with a slightly modified dataflow.;arxiv
5562;With FuSeConv, we achieve a significant speed-up of 3x-7x with the MobileNet family of networks on a systolic array of size 64x64, with comparable accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.;arxiv
5563;The high speed-up motivates exploration of hardware-aware Neural Operator Search (NOS) in complement to ongoing efforts on Neural Architecture Search (NAS).;arxiv
5564;Many off-policy prediction learning algorithms have been proposed in the past decade, but it remains unclear which algorithms learn faster than others.;arxiv
5565;We empirically compare 11 off-policy prediction learning algorithms with linear function approximation on two small tasks: the Rooms task, and the High Variance Rooms task.;arxiv
5566;The tasks are designed such that learning fast in them is challenging.;arxiv
5567;In the Rooms task, the product of importance sampling ratios can be as large as $2^{14}$ and can sometimes be two.;arxiv
5568;To control the high variance caused by the product of the importance sampling ratios, step size should be set small, which in turn slows down learning.;arxiv
5569;The High Variance Rooms task is more extreme in that the product of the ratios can become as large as $2^{14}\times 25$.;arxiv
5570;This paper builds upon the empirical study of off-policy prediction learning algorithms by Ghiassian and Sutton (2021).;arxiv
5571;We consider the same set of algorithms as theirs and employ the same experimental methodology.;arxiv
5572;We found that the algorithms' performance is highly affected by the variance induced by the importance sampling ratios.;arxiv
5573;We observed that Emphatic TD($\lambda$) tends to have lower asymptotic error than other algorithms, but might learn more slowly in some cases.;arxiv
5574;We suggest algorithms for practitioners based on their problem of interest, and suggest approaches that can be applied to specific algorithms that might result in substantially improved algorithms.;arxiv
5575;Tensor networks are factorisations of high rank tensors into networks of lower rank tensors and have primarily been used to analyse quantum many-body problems.;arxiv
5576;Tensor networks have seen a recent surge of interest in relation to supervised learning tasks with a focus on image classification.;arxiv
5577;In this work, we improve upon the matrix product state (MPS) tensor networks that can operate on one-dimensional vectors to be useful for working with 2D and 3D medical images.;arxiv
5578;We treat small image regions as orderless, squeeze their spatial information into feature dimensions and then perform MPS operations on these locally orderless regions.;arxiv
5579;These local representations are then aggregated in a hierarchical manner to retain global structure.;arxiv
5580;The proposed locally orderless tensor network (LoTeNet) is compared with relevant methods on three datasets.;arxiv
5581;The architecture of LoTeNet is fixed in all experiments and we show it requires lesser computational resources to attain performance on par or superior to the compared methods.;arxiv
5582;Modern solutions to the single image super-resolution (SISR) problem using deep neural networks aim not only at better performance accuracy but also at a lighter and computationally efficient model.;arxiv
5583;To that end, recently, neural architecture search (NAS) approaches have shown some tremendous potential.;arxiv
5584;Following the same underlying, in this paper, we suggest a novel trilevel NAS method that provides a better balance between different efficiency metrics and performance to solve SISR.;arxiv
5585;Unlike available NAS, our search is more complete, and therefore it leads to an efficient, optimized, and compressed architecture.;arxiv
5586;To make the search on trilevel spaces differentiable and efficient, we exploit a new sparsestmax technique that is excellent at generating sparse distributions of individual neural architecture candidates so that they can be better disentangled for the final selection from the enlarged search space.;arxiv
5587;We further introduce the sorting technique to the sparsestmax relaxation for better network-level compression.;arxiv
5588;The proposed NAS optimization additionally facilitates simultaneous search and training in a single phase, reducing search time and train time.;arxiv
5589;Comprehensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets show our method's clear superiority over the state-of-the-art NAS in terms of a good trade-off between model size, performance, and efficiency.;arxiv
5590;Speech sounds of spoken language are obtained by varying configuration of the articulators surrounding the vocal tract.;arxiv
5591;They contain abundant information that can be utilized to better understand the underlying mechanism of human speech production.;arxiv
5592;We propose a novel deep neural network-based learning framework that understands acoustic information in the variable-length sequence of vocal tract shaping during speech production, captured by real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI), and translate it into text.;arxiv
5593;The proposed framework comprises of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end.;arxiv
5594;On the USC-TIMIT corpus, the model achieved a 40.6% PER at sentence-level, much better compared to the existing models.;arxiv
5595;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the recognition of entire spoken sentence based on an individual's articulatory motions captured by rtMRI video.;arxiv
5596;Results suggest that each sub-regions distortion is affected by both emotion and gender.;arxiv
5597;Despite the surging demands for multilingual task-oriented dialog systems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home), there has been less research done in multilingual or cross-lingual scenarios.;arxiv
5598;Hence, we propose a zero-shot adaptation of task-oriented dialogue system to low-resource languages.;arxiv
5599;To tackle this challenge, we first use a set of very few parallel word pairs to refine the aligned cross-lingual word-level representations.;arxiv
5600;We then employ a latent variable model to cope with the variance of similar sentences across different languages, which is induced by imperfect cross-lingual alignments and inherent differences in languages.;arxiv
5601;This paper introduces, for the first time to our knowledge, physics-informed neural networks to accurately estimate the AC-OPF result and delivers rigorous guarantees about their performance.;arxiv
5602;Power system operators, along with several other actors, are increasingly using Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms for a wide number of applications, including planning and real-time operations.;arxiv
5603;However, in its original form, the AC Optimal Power Flow problem is often challenging to solve as it is non-linear and non-convex.;arxiv
5604;Besides the large number of approximations and relaxations, recent efforts have also been focusing on Machine Learning approaches, especially neural networks.;arxiv
5605;So far, however, these approaches have only partially considered the wide number of physical models available during training.;arxiv
5606;And, more importantly, they have offered no guarantees about potential constraint violations of their output.;arxiv
5607;Our approach (i) introduces the AC power flow equations inside neural network training and (ii) integrates methods that rigorously determine and reduce the worst-case constraint violations across the entire input domain, while maintaining the optimality of the prediction.;arxiv
5608;We demonstrate how physics-informed neural networks achieve higher accuracy and lower constraint violations than standard neural networks, and show how we can further reduce the worst-case violations for all neural networks.;arxiv
5609;Distances between data points are widely used in machine learning applications.;arxiv
5610;Yet, when corrupted by noise, these distances -- and thus the models based upon them -- may lose their usefulness in high dimensions.;arxiv
5611;Indeed, the small marginal effects of the noise may then accumulate quickly, shifting empirical closest and furthest neighbors away from the ground truth.;arxiv
5612;In this paper, we exactly characterize such effects in noisy high-dimensional data using an asymptotic probabilistic expression.;arxiv
5613;Previously, it has been argued that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable when distance concentration occurs, which means that there is a poor relative discrimination between the furthest and closest neighbors in the data.;arxiv
5614;However, we conclude that this is not necessarily the case when we decompose the data in a ground truth -- which we aim to recover -- and noise component.;arxiv
5615;More specifically, we derive that under particular conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by noise are still likely to be truthful even when distance concentration occurs.;arxiv
5616;We also include thorough empirical verification of our results, as well as interesting experiments in which our derived 'phase shift' where neighbors become random or not turns out to be identical to the phase shift where common dimensionality reduction methods perform poorly or well for recovering low-dimensional reconstructions of high-dimensional data with dense noise.;arxiv
5617;Monocular depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D recognition and understanding.;arxiv
5618;One key limitation of existing approaches lies in their lack of structural information exploitation, which leads to inaccurate spatial layout, discontinuous surface, and ambiguous boundaries.;arxiv
5619;In this paper, we tackle this problem in three aspects.;arxiv
5620;First, to exploit the spatial relationship of visual features, we propose a structure-aware neural network with spatial attention blocks.;arxiv
5621;These blocks guide the network attention to global structures or local details across different feature layers.;arxiv
5622;Second, we introduce a global focal relative loss for uniform point pairs to enhance spatial constraint in the prediction, and explicitly increase the penalty on errors in depth-wise discontinuous regions, which helps preserve the sharpness of estimation results.;arxiv
5623;Finally, based on analysis of failure cases for prior methods, we collect a new Hard Case (HC) Depth dataset of challenging scenes, such as special lighting conditions, dynamic objects, and tilted camera angles.;arxiv
5624;The new dataset is leveraged by an informed learning curriculum that mixes training examples incrementally to handle diverse data distributions.;arxiv
5625;Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of both prediction accuracy on NYUDv2 dataset and generalization performance on unseen datasets.;arxiv

5651;We develop the novel non-optimistic Global Under-Explore (GLUE) algorithm which uses the provided mean bounds (across all the arms) to infer pseudo-variances for each arm, which in turn decide the rate of exploration for the arms.;arxiv
5652;We analyze the regret of GLUE and prove regret upper bounds that are never worse than that of the standard UCB algorithm.;arxiv
5653;Furthermore, we show that GLUE improves upon regret guarantees that exists in literature for structured bandit problems (both theoretically and empirically).;arxiv
5654;Finally, we study the practical setting of learning adaptive interventions using prior data that has been confounded by unrecorded variables that affect rewards.;arxiv

5706;Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have recently emerged in the Deep Learning world for dealing with uncertainty estimation in classification tasks, and are used in many application domains such as astrophysics, autonomous driving...;arxiv
5707;BNN assume a prior over the weights of a neural network instead of point estimates, enabling in this way the estimation of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of the model prediction.;arxiv
5708;Moreover, a particular type of BNN, namely MC Dropout, assumes a Bernoulli distribution on the weights by using Dropout.;arxiv
5709;Several attempts to optimize the dropout rate exist, e.g. using a variational approach.;arxiv
5710;"In this paper, we present a new method called ""Dropout Regulation"" (DR), which consists of automatically adjusting the dropout rate during training using a controller as used in automation.";arxiv

5724;Skew-Gaussian processes (SkewGPs) extend the multivariate Unified Skew-Normal distributions over finite dimensional vectors to distribution over functions.;arxiv
5725;SkewGPs are more general and flexible than Gaussian processes, as SkewGPs may also represent asymmetric distributions.;arxiv
5726;In a recent contribution we showed that SkewGP and probit likelihood are conjugate, which allows us to compute the exact posterior for non-parametric binary classification and preference learning.;arxiv
5727;In this paper, we generalize previous results and we prove that SkewGP is conjugate with both the normal and affine probit likelihood, and more in general, with their product.;arxiv

5736;We establish a connection to the previously investigated matrix-space models for compositionality, and show they are special cases of the multiplicative recurrent net.;arxiv
5737;Our experiments show that these models perform comparably or better than Elman-type additive recurrent neural networks and outperform matrix-space models on a standard fine-grained sentiment analysis corpus.;arxiv

5739;Data privacy is a central problem for embodied agents that can perceive the environment, communicate with humans, and act in the real world.;arxiv
5740;In this work, we introduce privacy-preserving embodied agent learning for the task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an embodied agent navigates house environments by following natural language instructions.;arxiv
5741;We view each house environment as a local client, which shares nothing other than local updates with the cloud server and other clients, and propose a novel federated vision-and-language navigation (FedVLN) framework to protect data privacy during both training and pre-exploration.;arxiv
5742;Particularly, we propose a decentralized training strategy to limit the data of each client to its local model training and a federated pre-exploration method to do partial model aggregation to improve model generalizability to unseen environments.;arxiv
5743;Extensive results on R2R and RxR datasets show that under our FedVLN framework, decentralized VLN models achieve comparable results with centralized training while protecting seen environment privacy, and federated pre-exploration significantly outperforms centralized pre-exploration while preserving unseen environment privacy.;arxiv
5744;Gaussian variational approximation is a popular methodology to approximate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference especially in high dimensional and large data settings.;arxiv
5745;To control the computational cost while being able to capture the correlations among the variables, the low rank plus diagonal structure was introduced in the previous literature for the Gaussian covariance matrix.;arxiv
5746;For a specific Bayesian learning task, the uniqueness of the solution is usually ensured by imposing stringent constraints on the parameterized covariance matrix, which could break down during the optimization process.;arxiv
5747;In this paper, we consider two special covariance structures by applying the Stiefel manifold and Grassmann manifold constraints, to address the optimization difficulty in such factorization architectures.;arxiv

5750;Abc-boost is a new line of boosting algorithms for multi-class classification, by utilizing the commonly used sum-to-zero constraint.;arxiv
5751;To implement abc-boost, a base class must be identified at each boosting step.;arxiv
5752;Prior studies used a very expensive procedure based on exhaustive search for determining the base class at each boosting step.;arxiv
5753;Good testing performances of abc-boost (implemented as abc-mart and abc-logitboost) on a variety of datasets were reported.;arxiv
5754;For large datasets, however, the exhaustive search strategy adopted in prior abc-boost algorithms can be too prohibitive.;arxiv
5755;To overcome this serious limitation, this paper suggests a heuristic by introducing Gaps when computing the base class during training.;arxiv
5756;We test this idea on large datasets (Covertype and Poker) as well as datasets of moderate sizes.;arxiv
5757;On the large datasets, even with G=100 (or larger), there is essentially no loss of test accuracy.;arxiv
5758;On the moderate datasets, no obvious loss of test accuracy is observed when G<= 20~50.;arxiv
5759;Therefore, aided by this heuristic, it is promising that abc-boost will be a practical tool for accurate multi-class classification.;arxiv
5760;Nowadays, in many scientific and industrial fields there is an increasing need for estimating treatment effects and answering causal questions.;arxiv
5761;The key for addressing these problems is the wealth of observational data and the processes for leveraging this data.;arxiv

5765;Pauli spin blockade (PSB) can be employed as a great resource for spin qubit initialisation and readout even at elevated temperatures but it can be difficult to identify.;arxiv
5766;We present a machine learning algorithm capable of automatically identifying PSB using charge transport measurements.;arxiv
5767;The scarcity of PSB data is circumvented by training the algorithm with simulated data and by using cross-device validation.;arxiv
5768;We demonstrate our approach on a silicon field-effect transistor device and report an accuracy of 96% on different test devices, giving evidence that the approach is robust to device variability.;arxiv
5769;The approach is expected to be employable across all types of quantum dot devices.;arxiv
5770;In this paper, we focus on the fairness issues regarding unsupervised outlier detection.;arxiv
5771;Traditional algorithms, without a specific design for algorithmic fairness, could implicitly encode and propagate statistical bias in data and raise societal concerns.;arxiv
5772;To correct such unfairness and deliver a fair set of potential outlier candidates, we propose Deep Clustering based Fair Outlier Detection (DCFOD) that learns a good representation for utility maximization while enforcing the learnable representation to be subgroup-invariant on the sensitive attribute.;arxiv
5773;Considering the coupled and reciprocal nature between clustering and outlier detection, we leverage deep clustering to discover the intrinsic cluster structure and out-of-structure instances.;arxiv
5774;Meanwhile, an adversarial training erases the sensitive pattern for instances for fairness adaptation.;arxiv
5775;Technically, we propose an instance-level weighted representation learning strategy to enhance the joint deep clustering and outlier detection, where the dynamic weight module re-emphasizes contributions of likely-inliers while mitigating the negative impact from outliers.;arxiv
5776;Demonstrated by experiments on eight datasets comparing to 17 outlier detection algorithms, our DCFOD method consistently achieves superior performance on both the outlier detection validity and two types of fairness notions in outlier detection.;arxiv

5781;Existing methods on noisy label have focused on modifying the classifier during the training procedure.;arxiv
5782;First, these methods are not applicable to a pre-trained classifier without further access to training.;arxiv
5783;Second, it is not easy to train a classifier and regularize all negative effects from noisy labels, simultaneously.;arxiv
5784;We suggest a new branch of method, Noisy Prediction Calibration (NPC) in learning with noisy labels.;arxiv
5785;Through the introduction and estimation of a new type of transition matrix via generative model, NPC corrects the noisy prediction from the pre-trained classifier to the true label as a post-processing scheme.;arxiv
5786;We prove that NPC theoretically aligns with the transition matrix based methods.;arxiv
5787;Yet, NPC empirically provides more accurate pathway to estimate true label, even without involvement in classifier learning.;arxiv
5788;Also, NPC is applicable to any classifier trained with noisy label methods, if training instances and its predictions are available.;arxiv
5789;Our method, NPC, boosts the classification performances of all baseline models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.;arxiv
5790;In this article, we study shape fitting problems, $\epsilon$-coresets, and total sensitivity.;arxiv
5791;We focus on the $(j,k)$-projective clustering problems, including $k$-median/$k$-means, $k$-line clustering, $j$-subspace approximation, and the integer $(j,k)$-projective clustering problem.;arxiv
5792;We derive upper bounds of total sensitivities for these problems, and obtain $\epsilon$-coresets using these upper bounds.;arxiv
5793;Using a dimension-reduction type argument, we are able to greatly simplify earlier results on total sensitivity for the $k$-median/$k$-means clustering problems, and obtain positively-weighted $\epsilon$-coresets for several variants of the $(j,k)$-projective clustering problem.;arxiv

5795;This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as APIs.;arxiv
5796;However, BERT-based APIs have exhibited a series of security and privacy vulnerabilities.;arxiv
5797;For example, prior work has exploited the security issues of the BERT-based APIs through the adversarial examples crafted by the extracted model.;arxiv
5798;However, the privacy leakage problems of the BERT-based APIs through the extracted model have not been well studied.;arxiv
5799;On the other hand, due to the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be overlearned, but what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model remains unknown.;arxiv
5800;In this work, we bridge this gap by first presenting an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can practically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a limited number of queries.;arxiv
5801;We further develop an effective attribute inference attack which can infer the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the BERT-based APIs.;arxiv
5802;Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various realistic settings validate the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based APIs.;arxiv
5803;Moreover, we demonstrate that two promising defense methods become ineffective against our attacks, which calls for more effective defense methods.;arxiv
5804;Imitation learning enables high-fidelity, vision-based learning of policies within rich, photorealistic environments.;arxiv
5805;However, such techniques often rely on traditional discrete-time neural models and face difficulties in generalizing to domain shifts by failing to account for the causal relationships between the agent and the environment.;arxiv
5806;In this paper, we propose a theoretical and experimental framework for learning causal representations using continuous-time neural networks, specifically over their discrete-time counterparts.;arxiv
5807;We evaluate our method in the context of visual-control learning of drones over a series of complex tasks, ranging from short- and long-term navigation, to chasing static and dynamic objects through photorealistic environments.;arxiv

5813;First, the mind-map and taxonomy of machine learning, neural networks, and Turing machine are introduced.;arxiv
5814;Finally, the paper discusses on issues and ends up with several future works.;arxiv
5815;The ability to transfer adversarial attacks from one model (the surrogate) to another model (the victim) has been an issue of concern within the machine learning (ML) community.;arxiv
5816;The ability to successfully evade unseen models represents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks.;arxiv
5817;In this work we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an unrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same training data as the victim.;arxiv
5818;We present the first study of transferring adversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under imperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable level of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each model.;arxiv
5819;This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and others.;arxiv
5820;Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with data or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset.;arxiv
5821;This makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other and contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security.;arxiv
5822;We remedy this by developing a masked version of Projected Gradient Descent that simulates class disparity, which enables the attacker to reliably estimate a lower-bound on their attack's success.;arxiv
5823;With the advent of powerful, low-cost IoT systems, processing data closer to where the data originates, known as edge computing, has become an increasingly viable option.;arxiv

5831;Knitting is an effective technique for producing complex three-dimensional surfaces owing to the inherent flexibility of interlooped yarns and recent advances in manufacturing providing better control of local stitch patterns.;arxiv
5832;Fully yarn-level modelling of large-scale knitted membranes is not feasible.;arxiv
5833;Therefore, we use a two-scale homogenisation approach and model the membrane as a Kirchhoff-Love shell on the macroscale and as Euler-Bernoulli rods on the microscale.;arxiv
5834;The governing equations for both the shell and the rod are discretised with cubic B-spline basis functions.;arxiv
5835;For homogenisation we consider only the in-plane response of the membrane.;arxiv
5836;The solution of the nonlinear microscale problem requires a significant amount of time due to the large deformations and the enforcement of contact constraints, rendering conventional online computational homogenisation approaches infeasible.;arxiv
5837;To sidestep this problem, we use a pre-trained statistical Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to map the macroscale deformations to macroscale stresses.;arxiv
5838;During the offline learning phase, the GPR model is trained by solving the microscale problem for a sufficiently rich set of deformation states obtained by either uniform or Sobol sampling.;arxiv
5839;The trained GPR model encodes the nonlinearities and anisotropies present in the microscale and serves as a material model for the membrane response of the macroscale shell.;arxiv
5840;The bending response can be chosen in dependence of the mesh size to penalise the fine out-of-plane wrinkling of the membrane.;arxiv

5842;There are partially separable data types that make classification tasks very hard.;arxiv
5843;In other words, only parts of the data are informative meaning that looking at the rest of the data would not give any distinguishable hint for classification.;arxiv
5844;In this situation, the typical assumption of having the whole labeled data as an informative unit set for classification does not work.;arxiv
5845;Consequently, typical classification methods with the mentioned assumption fail in such a situation.;arxiv
5846;In this study, we propose a framework for the classification of partially separable data types that are not classifiable using typical methods.;arxiv
5847;An algorithm based on the framework is proposed that tries to detect separable subgroups of the data using an iterative clustering approach.;arxiv

5850;In many games humans on average do not achieve maximal payoff and the behaviour of individual players remains inhomogeneous even after playing many rounds.;arxiv
5851;For instance, in repeated prisoner dilemma games humans do not always optimize their mean reward and frequently exhibit broad distributions of cooperativity.;arxiv
5852;The reasons for these failures of maximization are not known.;arxiv
5853;Here we show that the dynamics resulting from the tendency to shift choice probabilities towards previously rewarding choices in closed loop interaction with the strategy of the opponent can not only explain systematic deviations from 'rationality', but also reproduce the diversity of choice behaviours.;arxiv
5854;As a representative example we investigate the dynamics of choice probabilities in prisoner dilemma games with opponents using strategies with different degrees of extortion and generosity.;arxiv
5855;We find that already a simple model for human learning can account for a surprisingly wide range of human decision behaviours.;arxiv
5856;It reproduces suppression of cooperation against extortionists and increasing cooperation when playing with generous opponents, explains the broad distributions of individual choices in ensembles of players, and predicts the evolution of individual subjects' cooperation rates over the course of the games.;arxiv
5857;We conclude that important aspects of human decision behaviours are rooted in elementary learning mechanisms realised in the brain.;arxiv
5858;Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms contain inductive biases that sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment.;arxiv
5859;These inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned hyper-parameters.;arxiv
5860;In general, there is a trade-off between generality and performance when algorithms use such biases.;arxiv
5861;Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms.;arxiv
5862;In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that bias the objective and the environmental interface of common deep reinforcement learning agents.;arxiv
5863;We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when these components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature.;arxiv
5864;In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better.;arxiv
5865;We investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system.;arxiv
5866;As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components performed better on many of the new tasks.;arxiv
5867;In this paper, we tackle the problem of handling narrowband and wideband speech by building a single acoustic model (AM), also called mixed bandwidth AM.;arxiv
5868;In the proposed approach, an auxiliary input feature is used to provide the bandwidth information to the model, and bandwidth embeddings are jointly learned as part of acoustic model training.;arxiv
5869;Experimental evaluations show that using bandwidth embeddings helps the model to handle the variability of the narrow and wideband speech, and makes it possible to train a mixed-bandwidth AM.;arxiv
5870;Furthermore, we propose to use parallel convolutional layers to handle the mismatch between the narrow and wideband speech better, where separate convolution layers are used for each type of input speech signal.;arxiv
5871;Our best system achieves 13% relative improvement on narrowband speech, while not degrading on wideband speech.;arxiv
5872;We consider an online learning to rank setting in which, at each round, an oblivious adversary generates a list of $m$ documents, pertaining to a query, and the learner produces scores to rank the documents.;arxiv
5873;The adversary then generates a relevance vector and the learner updates its ranker according to the feedback received.;arxiv
5874;We develop efficient algorithms for well known losses in the pointwise, pairwise and listwise families.;arxiv
5875;We also prove that no online algorithm can have sublinear regret, with top-1 feedback, for any loss that is calibrated with respect to NDCG.;arxiv
5876;We apply our algorithms on benchmark datasets demonstrating efficient online learning of a ranking function from highly restricted feedback.;arxiv
5877;In order to contrast the explosion in size of state-of-the-art machine learning models that can be attributed to the empirical advantages of over-parametrization, and due to the necessity of deploying fast, sustainable, and private on-device models on resource-constrained devices, the community has focused on techniques such as pruning, quantization, and distillation as central strategies for model compression.;arxiv
5878;Towards the goal of facilitating the adoption of a common interface for neural network pruning in PyTorch, this contribution describes the recent addition of the PyTorch torch.nn.utils.prune module, which provides shared, open source pruning functionalities to lower the technical implementation barrier to reducing model size and capacity before, during, and/or after training.;arxiv

5880;Analytical performance models are very effective in ensuring the quality of service and cost of service deployment remain desirable under different conditions and workloads.;arxiv
5881;While various analytical performance models have been proposed for previous paradigms in cloud computing, serverless computing lacks such models that can provide developers with performance guarantees.;arxiv
5882;Besides, most serverless computing platforms still require developers' input to specify the configuration for their deployment that could affect both the performance and cost of their deployment, without providing them with any direct and immediate feedback.;arxiv
5883;In previous studies, we built such performance models for steady-state and transient analysis of scale-per-request serverless computing platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) that could give developers immediate feedback about the quality of service and cost of their deployments.;arxiv
5884;In this work, we aim to develop analytical performance models for the latest trend in serverless computing platforms that use concurrency value and the rate of requests per second for autoscaling decisions.;arxiv
5885;Examples of such serverless computing platforms are Knative and Google Cloud Run (a managed Knative service by Google).;arxiv
5886;The proposed performance model can help developers and providers predict the performance and cost of deployments with different configurations which could help them tune the configuration toward the best outcome.;arxiv
5887;We validate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed performance model by extensive real-world experimentation on Knative and show that our performance model is able to accurately predict the steady-state characteristics of a given workload with minimal amount of data collection.;arxiv

5891;Federated learning is a distributed framework according to which a model is trained over a set of devices, while keeping data localized.;arxiv
5892;This framework faces several systems-oriented challenges which include (i) communication bottleneck since a large number of devices upload their local updates to a parameter server, and (ii) scalability as the federated network consists of millions of devices.;arxiv
5893;Due to these systems challenges as well as issues related to statistical heterogeneity of data and privacy concerns, designing a provably efficient federated learning method is of significant importance yet it remains challenging.;arxiv
5894;In this paper, we present FedPAQ, a communication-efficient Federated Learning method with Periodic Averaging and Quantization.;arxiv
5895;These features address the communications and scalability challenges in federated learning.;arxiv

5897;Deep networks trained on large-scale data can learn transferable features to promote learning multiple tasks.;arxiv
5898;Since deep features eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks, a fundamental problem of multi-task learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying parameter tensors and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers.;arxiv
5899;This paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks.;arxiv
5900;By jointly learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and features, MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer.;arxiv
5901;Experiments show that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.;arxiv
5902;We seek to automate the design of molecules based on specific chemical properties.;arxiv
5903;This approach uses substantially fewer model steps per atom than earlier approaches, thus enabling generation of larger molecules, and beats previous state-of-the art baselines by a significant margin.;arxiv
5904;Applying reinforcement learning to a combination of a custom context-free grammar with additional masking to enforce non-local constraints is applicable to any optimization of a graph structure under a mixture of local and nonlocal constraints.;arxiv
5905;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in processing natural language tasks and achieve huge success.;arxiv
5906;Traditional RNNs usually treat each token in a sentence uniformly and equally.;arxiv
5907;However, this may miss the rich semantic structure information of a sentence, which is useful for understanding natural languages.;arxiv
5908;Since semantic structures such as word dependence patterns are not parameterized, it is a challenge to capture and leverage structure information.;arxiv
5909;In this paper, we propose an improved variant of RNN, Multi-Channel RNN (MC-RNN), to dynamically capture and leverage local semantic structure information.;arxiv
5910;Concretely, MC-RNN contains multiple channels, each of which represents a local dependence pattern at a time.;arxiv
5911;An attention mechanism is introduced to combine these patterns at each step, according to the semantic information.;arxiv
5912;Then we parameterize structure information by adaptively selecting the most appropriate connection structures among channels.;arxiv
5913;In this way, diverse local structures and dependence patterns in sentences can be well captured by MC-RNN.;arxiv
5914;To verify the effectiveness of MC-RNN, we conduct extensive experiments on typical natural language processing tasks, including neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling.;arxiv
5915;Experimental results on these tasks all show significant improvements of MC-RNN over current top systems.;arxiv
5916;These systems typically consist of Spoken Language understanding component which, in turn, consists of two tasks - Intent Classification (IC) and Slot Labeling (SL).;arxiv
5917;Generally, these two tasks are modeled together jointly to achieve best performance.;arxiv
5918;However, this joint modeling adds to model obfuscation.;arxiv
5919;In this work, we first design framework for a modularization of joint IC-SL task to enhance architecture transparency.;arxiv
5920;Then, we explore a number of self-attention, convolutional, and recurrent models, contributing a large-scale analysis of modeling paradigms for IC+SL across two datasets.;arxiv
5921;Finally, using this framework, we propose a class of 'label-recurrent' models that otherwise non-recurrent, with a 10-dimensional representation of the label history, and show that our proposed systems are easy to interpret, highly accurate (achieving over 30% error reduction in SL over the state-of-the-art on the Snips dataset), as well as fast, at 2x the inference and 2/3 to 1/2 the training time of comparable recurrent models, thus giving an edge in critical real-world systems.;arxiv
5922;Protein secondary structure is crucial to creating an information bridge between the primary and tertiary (3D) structures.;arxiv
5923;Precise prediction of eight-state protein secondary structure (PSS) has significantly utilized in the structural and functional analysis of proteins in bioinformatics.;arxiv
5924;Deep learning techniques have been recently applied in this research area and raised the eight-state (Q8) protein secondary structure prediction accuracy remarkably.;arxiv
5925;Nevertheless, from a theoretical standpoint, there are still lots of rooms for improvement, specifically in the eight-state PSS prediction.;arxiv
5926;In this study, we have presented a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), namely PS8-Net, to enhance the accuracy of eight-class PSS prediction.;arxiv
5927;The input of this architecture is a carefully constructed feature matrix from the proteins sequence features and profile features.;arxiv
5928;We introduce a new PS8 module in the network, which is applied with skip connection to extracting the long-term inter-dependencies from higher layers, obtaining local contexts in earlier layers, and achieving global information during secondary structure prediction.;arxiv
5929;Our proposed PS8-Net achieves 76.89%, 71.94%, 76.86%, and 75.26% Q8 accuracy respectively on benchmark CullPdb6133, CB513, CASP10, and CASP11 datasets.;arxiv
5930;This architecture enables the efficient processing of local and global interdependencies between amino acids to make an accurate prediction of each class.;arxiv
5931;To the best of our knowledge, PS8-Net experiment results demonstrate that it outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods on the aforementioned benchmark datasets.;arxiv
5932;Deployment of machine learning models in real high-risk settings (e.g. healthcare) often depends not only on the model's accuracy but also on its fairness, robustness, and interpretability.;arxiv
5933;Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are a class of interpretable models with a long history of use in these high-risk domains, but they lack desirable features of deep learning such as differentiability and scalability.;arxiv
5934;In this work, we propose a neural GAM (NODE-GAM) and neural GA$^2$M (NODE-GA$^2$M) that scale well and perform better than other GAMs on large datasets, while remaining interpretable compared to other ensemble and deep learning models.;arxiv
5935;We demonstrate that our models find interesting patterns in the data.;arxiv
5936;Lastly, we show that we improve model accuracy via self-supervised pre-training, an improvement that is not possible for non-differentiable GAMs.;arxiv
5937;In convex optimization, the problem of finding near-stationary points has not been adequately studied yet, unlike other optimality measures such as the function value.;arxiv
5938;Even in the deterministic case, the optimal method (OGM-G, due to Kim and Fessler (2021)) has just been discovered recently.;arxiv
5939;In this work, we conduct a systematic study of algorithmic techniques for finding near-stationary points of convex finite-sums.;arxiv
5940;We put an emphasis on the simplicity and practicality of the new schemes, which could facilitate future work.;arxiv
5941;In knowledge distillation, since a single, omnipotent teacher network cannot solve all problems, multiple teacher-based knowledge distillations have been studied recently.;arxiv
5942;However, sometimes their improvements are not as good as expected because some immature teachers may transfer the false knowledge to the student.;arxiv
5943;In this paper, to overcome this limitation and take the efficacy of the multiple networks, we divide the multiple networks into teacher and student groups, respectively.;arxiv
5944;That is, the student group is a set of immature networks that require learning the teacher's knowledge, while the teacher group consists of the selected networks that have performed well.;arxiv
5945;Furthermore, according to our online role change strategy, the top-ranked networks in the student group are able to promote to the teacher group at every iteration and vice versa.;arxiv
5946;After training the teacher group using the error images of the student group to refine the teacher group's knowledge, we transfer the collective knowledge from the teacher group to the student group successfully.;arxiv
5947;We verify the superiority of the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which achieves high performance.;arxiv
5948;We further show the generality of our method with various backbone architectures such as resent, wrn, vgg, mobilenet, and shufflenet.;arxiv
5949;Recent works have shown that modern machine learning techniques can provide an alternative approach to the long-standing joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem.;arxiv
5950;Very promising initial results, superior to popular digital schemes that utilize separate source and channel codes, have been demonstrated for wireless image and video transmission using deep neural networks (DNNs).;arxiv
5951;This can prevent the application of these codes in scenarios where the hardware or protocol can only admit certain sets of channel inputs, prescribed by a digital constellation.;arxiv
5952;Herein, we propose DeepJSCC-Q, an end-to-end optimized JSCC solution for wireless image transmission using a finite channel input alphabet.;arxiv
5953;We show that DeepJSCC-Q can achieve similar performance to prior works that allow any complex valued channel input, especially when high modulation orders are available, and that the performance asymptotically approaches that of unconstrained channel input as the modulation order increases.;arxiv
5954;Importantly, DeepJSCC-Q preserves the graceful degradation of image quality in unpredictable channel conditions, a desirable property for deployment in mobile systems with rapidly changing channel conditions.;arxiv
5955;Several learning applications require solving high-dimensional regression problems where the relevant features belong to a small number of (overlapping) groups.;arxiv
5956;For very large datasets and under standard sparsity constraints, hard thresholding methods have proven to be extremely efficient, but such methods require NP hard projections when dealing with overlapping groups.;arxiv
5957;These methods exhibit an interesting computation-accuracy trade-off and can be extended to significantly harder problems such as sparse overlapping groups.;arxiv
5958;Experiments on both real and synthetic data validate our claims and demonstrate that the proposed methods are orders of magnitude faster than other greedy and convex relaxation techniques for learning with group-structured sparsity.;arxiv
5959;We present a fast, scalable, data-driven approach for solving linear relaxations of 0-1 integer linear programs using a graph neural network.;arxiv
5960;Our solver is based on the Lagrange decomposition based algorithm FastDOG (Abbas et al. (2022)).;arxiv
5961;We make the algorithm differentiable and perform backpropagation through the dual update scheme for end-to-end training of its algorithmic parameters.;arxiv
5962;This allows to preserve the algorithm's theoretical properties including feasibility and guaranteed non-decrease in the lower bound.;arxiv
5963;Since FastDOG can get stuck in suboptimal fixed points, we provide additional freedom to our graph neural network to predict non-parametric update steps for escaping such points while maintaining dual feasibility.;arxiv
5964;For training of the graph neural network we use an unsupervised loss and perform experiments on large-scale real world datasets.;arxiv
5965;We train on smaller problems and test on larger ones showing strong generalization performance with a graph neural network comprising only around 10k parameters.;arxiv
5966;Our solver achieves significantly faster performance and better dual objectives than its non-learned version.;arxiv

5970;Although various accelerated variants of SVRG (e.g., Katyusha and Acc-Prox-SVRG) have been proposed, the direct acceleration of SAGA still remains unknown.;arxiv
5971;In this paper, we propose a directly accelerated variant of SAGA using a novel Sampled Negative Momentum (SSNM), which achieves the best known oracle complexity for strongly convex problems (with known strong convexity parameter).;arxiv

5976;These bounds are tight either when U is independent of T or when U is independent of Y given T (when there is no unobserved confounding).;arxiv
5977;We discuss possible calibration strategies for this bound to get interval estimates for treatment effects, and experimentally validate the bound using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.;arxiv
5978;Bayesian optimization is known to be difficult to scale to high dimensions, because the acquisition step requires solving a non-convex optimization problem in the same search space.;arxiv
5979;In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively chosen one-dimensional sub-problems that can be solved efficiently.;arxiv
5980;We show that our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function is strongly convex.;arxiv

5996;The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork.;arxiv
5997;HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks.;arxiv
5998;We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as $0.14\%$ of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency.;arxiv

6013;PSL represents first-order logic in terms of a convex graphical model -- Hinge Loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs).;arxiv
6014;PSL stands out among probabilistic logic frameworks due to its tractability having been applied to systems of more than 1 billion ground rules.;arxiv
6015;The key to our approach is to represent predicates in first-order logic using deep neural networks and then to approximately back-propagate through the HL-MRF and thus train every aspect of the first-order system being represented.;arxiv

6019;For most existing federated learning algorithms, each round consists of minimizing a loss function at each client to learn an optimal model at the client, followed by aggregating these client models at the server.;arxiv
6020;Point estimation of the model parameters at the clients does not take into account the uncertainty in the models estimated at each client.;arxiv
6021;In many situations, however, especially in limited data settings, it is beneficial to take into account the uncertainty in the client models for more accurate and robust predictions.;arxiv
6022;Uncertainty also provides useful information for other important tasks, such as active learning and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.;arxiv
6023;We present a framework for Bayesian federated learning where each client infers the posterior predictive distribution using its training data and present various ways to aggregate these client-specific predictive distributions at the server.;arxiv
6024;Since communicating and aggregating predictive distributions can be challenging and expensive, our approach is based on distilling each client's predictive distribution into a single deep neural network.;arxiv
6025;This enables us to leverage advances in standard federated learning to Bayesian federated learning as well.;arxiv
6026;Unlike some recent works that have tried to estimate model uncertainty of each client, our work also does not make any restrictive assumptions, such as the form of the client's posterior distribution.;arxiv

6034;SDU-Net adopts the architecture of vanilla U-Net with modifications in the encoder and decoder operations (an operation indicates all the processing for feature maps of the same resolution).;arxiv
6035;Unlike vanilla U-Net which incorporates two standard convolutions in each encoder/decoder operation, SDU-Net uses one standard convolution followed by multiple dilated convolutions and concatenates all dilated convolution outputs as input to the next operation.;arxiv
6036;Experiments showed that SDU-Net outperformed vanilla U-Net, attention U-Net (AttU-Net), and recurrent residual U-Net (R2U-Net) in all four tested segmentation tasks while using parameters around 40% of vanilla U-Net's, 17% of AttU-Net's, and 15% of R2U-Net's.;arxiv
6037;Distributed gradient descent (DGD) is an efficient way of implementing gradient descent (GD), especially for large data sets, by dividing the computation tasks into smaller subtasks and assigning to different computing servers (CSs) to be executed in parallel.;arxiv
6038;In standard parallel execution, per-iteration waiting time is limited by the execution time of the straggling servers.;arxiv
6039;Coded DGD techniques have been introduced recently, which can tolerate straggling servers via assigning redundant computation tasks to the CSs.;arxiv
6040;In most of the existing DGD schemes, either with coded computation or coded communication, the non-straggling CSs transmit one message per iteration once they complete all their assigned computation tasks.;arxiv
6041;However, although the straggling servers cannot complete all their assigned tasks, they are often able to complete a certain portion of them.;arxiv
6042;In this paper, we allow multiple transmissions from each CS at each iteration in order to make sure a maximum number of completed computations can be reported to the aggregating server (AS), including the straggling servers.;arxiv
6043;We numerically show that the average completion time per iteration can be reduced significantly by slightly increasing the communication load per server.;arxiv
6044;Recognition tasks, such as object recognition and keypoint estimation, have seen widespread adoption in recent years.;arxiv
6045;Most state-of-the-art methods for these tasks use deep networks that are computationally expensive and have huge memory footprints.;arxiv
6046;This makes it exceedingly difficult to deploy these systems on low power embedded devices.;arxiv
6047;Hence, the importance of decreasing the storage requirements and the amount of computation in such models is paramount.;arxiv

6053;We provide quantitative bounds measuring the $L^2$ difference in function space between the trajectory of a finite-width network trained on finitely many samples from the idealized kernel dynamics of infinite width and infinite data.;arxiv
6054;An implication of the bounds is that the network is biased to learn the top eigenfunctions of the Neural Tangent Kernel not just on the training set but over the entire input space.;arxiv
6055;This bias depends on the model architecture and input distribution alone and thus does not depend on the target function which does not need to be in the RKHS of the kernel.;arxiv
6056;The result is valid for deep architectures with fully connected, convolutional, and residual layers.;arxiv
6057;Furthermore the width does not need to grow polynomially with the number of samples in order to obtain high probability bounds up to a stopping time.;arxiv
6058;The proof exploits the low-effective-rank property of the Fisher Information Matrix at initialization, which implies a low effective dimension of the model (far smaller than the number of parameters).;arxiv
6059;We conclude that local capacity control from the low effective rank of the Fisher Information Matrix is still underexplored theoretically.;arxiv

6061;Covid-19 attacks not only the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other vital organs of the body, with possible sequela.;arxiv
6062;At present, the detection of COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).;arxiv
6063;However, many countries are in the outbreak period of the epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited.;arxiv

6066;The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to enhance the data.;arxiv
6067;We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia.;arxiv
6068;Then we used SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and determined if it is caused by COVID-19.;arxiv

6080;We developed a novel multi-task CNN-based spatio-temporal fetal US feature extraction and standard plane detection algorithm (called FUVAI) and evaluated the method on 50 freehand fetal US video scans.;arxiv
6081;We compared FUVAI fetal biometric measurements with measurements made by five experienced sonographers at two time points separated by at least two weeks.;arxiv
6082;We found that automated fetal biometric measurements obtained by FUVAI were comparable to the measurements performed by experienced sonographers The observed differences in measurement values were within the range of inter- and intra-observer variability.;arxiv
6083;Moreover, analysis has shown that these differences were not statistically significant when comparing any individual medical expert to our model.;arxiv
6084;We argue that FUVAI has the potential to assist sonographers who perform fetal biometric measurements in clinical settings by providing them with suggestions regarding the best measuring frames, along with automated measurements.;arxiv
6085;Moreover, FUVAI is able perform these tasks in just a few seconds, which is a huge difference compared to the average of six minutes taken by sonographers.;arxiv
6086;This is significant, given the shortage of medical experts capable of interpreting fetal ultrasound images in numerous countries.;arxiv

6096;Deep neural networks (DNNs) are one of the most highlighted methods in machine learning.;arxiv
6097;However, as DNNs are black-box models, they lack explanatory power for their predictions.;arxiv
6098;Recently, neural additive models (NAMs) have been proposed to provide this power while maintaining high prediction performance.;arxiv
6099;In this paper, we propose a novel NAM approach for multivariate nowcasting (NC) problems, which comprise an important focus area of machine learning.;arxiv
6100;For the multivariate time-series data used in NC problems, explanations should be considered for every input value to the variables at distinguishable time steps.;arxiv
6101;By employing generalized additive models, the proposed NAM-NC successfully explains each input value's importance for multiple variables and time steps.;arxiv
6102;Experimental results involving a toy example and two real-world datasets show that the NAM-NC predicts multivariate time-series data as accurately as state-of-the-art neural networks, while also providing the explanatory importance of each input value.;arxiv

6104;We develop a new method to detect anomalies within time series, which is essential in many application domains, reaching from self-driving cars, finance, and marketing to medical diagnosis and epidemiology.;arxiv
6105;The method is based on self-supervised deep learning that has played a key role in facilitating deep anomaly detection on images, where powerful image transformations are available.;arxiv
6106;However, such transformations are widely unavailable for time series.;arxiv
6107;Addressing this, we develop Local Neural Transformations(LNT), a method learning local transformations of time series from data.;arxiv
6108;The method produces an anomaly score for each time step and thus can be used to detect anomalies within time series.;arxiv
6109;We prove in a theoretical analysis that our novel training objective is more suitable for transformation learning than previous deep Anomaly detection(AD) methods.;arxiv
6110;Our experiments demonstrate that LNT can find anomalies in speech segments from the LibriSpeech data set and better detect interruptions to cyber-physical systems than previous work.;arxiv

6112;The operation and management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as traffic monitoring, relies on real-time data aggregation of vehicular traffic information, including vehicular types (e.g., cars, trucks, and buses), in the critical roads and highways.;arxiv
6113;While traditional approaches based on vehicular-embedded GPS sensors or camera networks would either invade drivers' privacy or require high deployment cost, this paper introduces a low-cost method, namely SenseMag, to recognize the vehicular type using a pair of non-invasive magnetic sensors deployed on the straight road section.;arxiv
6114;SenseMag filters out noises and segments received magnetic signals by the exact time points that the vehicle arrives or departs from every sensor node.;arxiv
6115;Further, SenseMag adopts a hierarchical recognition model to first estimate the speed/velocity, then identify the length of vehicle using the predicted speed, sampling cycles, and the distance between the sensor nodes.;arxiv
6116;With the vehicle length identified and the temporal/spectral features extracted from the magnetic signals, SenseMag classify the types of vehicles accordingly.;arxiv
6117;Some semi-automated learning techniques have been adopted for the design of filters, features, and the choice of hyper-parameters.;arxiv
6118;To be specific, our field experiment results validate that SenseMag is with at least $90\%$ vehicle type classification accuracy and less than 5\% vehicle length classification error.;arxiv

6121;For instance, dataset condensation (DC) matches network gradients w.r.t.;arxiv
6122;large-real data and small-synthetic data, where the network weights are optimized for multiple steps at each outer iteration.;arxiv
6123;To bridge the gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation tailored for graph datasets where we model the discrete graph structure as a probabilistic model.;arxiv
6124;We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only one single step without training the network weights.;arxiv
6125;Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic graphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs.;arxiv
6126;Extensive experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.;arxiv
6127;In particular, we are able to reduce the dataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance and our method is significantly faster than multi-step gradient matching (e.g. 15x in CIFAR10 for synthesizing 500 graphs).;arxiv
6128;"Despite the increasing visibility of fine-grained recognition in our field, ""fine-grained'' has thus far lacked a precise definition.";arxiv
6129;In this work, building upon clustering theory, we pursue a framework for measuring dataset granularity.;arxiv
6130;We argue that dataset granularity should depend not only on the data samples and their labels, but also on the distance function we choose.;arxiv
6131;We propose an axiomatic framework to capture desired properties for a dataset granularity measure and provide examples of measures that satisfy these properties.;arxiv
6132;We assess each measure via experiments on datasets with hierarchical labels of varying granularity.;arxiv
6133;When measuring granularity in commonly used datasets with our measure, we find that certain datasets that are widely considered fine-grained in fact contain subsets of considerable size that are substantially more coarse-grained than datasets generally regarded as coarse-grained.;arxiv
6134;We also investigate the interplay between dataset granularity with a variety of factors and find that fine-grained datasets are more difficult to learn from, more difficult to transfer to, more difficult to perform few-shot learning with, and more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.;arxiv

6136;We prove upper and lower bounds on the approximation error of these networks for smooth function classes.;arxiv
6137;The lower bound is derived through the Rademacher complexity of neural networks, which may be of independent interest.;arxiv
6138;We apply these approximation bounds to analyze the convergence of regression using norm constrained neural networks and distribution estimation by GANs.;arxiv

6147;However, training good DLMs can be time consuming especially for production-size models and corpora.;arxiv
6148;Although several parallel training algorithms have been proposed to improve training efficiency, there is no clear guidance on which one to choose for the task in hand due to lack of systematic and fair comparison among them.;arxiv
6149;Based on our experiments, we recommend using BMUF as the top choice to train acoustic models since it is most stable, scales well with number of GPUs, can achieve reproducible results, and in many cases even outperforms single-GPU SGD.;arxiv
6150;ASGD can be used as a substitute in some cases.;arxiv
6151;Design optimization techniques are often used at the beginning of the design process to explore the space of possible designs.;arxiv
6152;In these domains illumination algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are promising alternatives to classic optimization algorithms because they produce diverse, high-quality solutions in a single run, instead of only a single near-optimal solution.;arxiv
6153;Unfortunately, these algorithms currently require a large number of function evaluations, limiting their applicability.;arxiv
6154;In this article we introduce a new illumination algorithm, Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL), that leverages surrogate modeling techniques to create a map of the design space according to user-defined features while minimizing the number of fitness evaluations.;arxiv

6162;We then review recent advances in applying deep learning to network data, and show how these methods may be used to address many of the methodological problems we identified.;arxiv
6163;We particularly emphasize deep generative methods, which can be used to generate realistic synthetic networks useful for microsimulation and agent-based models capable of informing key public policy questions.;arxiv
6164;We extend these recent advances by developing a new generative framework which applies to large social contact networks commonly used in epidemiological modeling.;arxiv
6165;For context, we also compare and contrast these recent neural network-based approaches with the more traditional Exponential Random Graph Models.;arxiv
6166;Lastly, we discuss some open problems where more progress is needed.;arxiv
6167;With deep learning gaining attention from the research community for prediction and control of real physical systems, learning important representations is becoming now more than ever mandatory.;arxiv
6168;It is of extreme importance that deep learning representations are coherent with physics.;arxiv
6169;When learning from discrete data this can be guaranteed by including some sort of prior into the learning, however, not all discretization priors preserve important structures from the physics.;arxiv
6170;In this paper, we introduce Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (SyMo) as models from a discrete formulation of mechanics for non-separable mechanical systems.;arxiv
6171;The combination of such formulation leads SyMos to be constrained towards preserving important geometric structures such as momentum and a symplectic form and learn from limited data.;arxiv
6172;Furthermore, it allows to learn dynamics only from the poses as training data.;arxiv
6173;We extend SyMos to include variational integrators within the learning framework by developing an implicit root-find layer which leads to End-to-End Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (E2E-SyMo).;arxiv
6174;Through experimental results, using the pendulum and cartpole, we show that such combination not only allows these models to learn from limited data but also provides the models with the capability of preserving the symplectic form and show better long-term behaviour.;arxiv
6175;We provide several new depth-based separation results for feed-forward neural networks, proving that various types of simple and natural functions can be better approximated using deeper networks than shallower ones, even if the shallower networks are much larger.;arxiv
6176;We also show that these gaps can be observed experimentally: Increasing the depth indeed allows better learning than increasing width, when training neural networks to learn an indicator of a unit ball.;arxiv
6177;Neural networks represent a field of research that can quickly achieve very good results in the field of medical image segmentation using a GPU.;arxiv
6178;A possible way to achieve good results without GPUs are random forests.;arxiv

6187;In this paper we analysed K-Means with Automatic Generations of Merge Factor for ISODATA- AGMFI, to group the microarray data sets on the basic of ISODATA.;arxiv
6188;AGMFI is to generate initial values for merge and Spilt factor, maximum merge times instead of selecting efficient values as in ISODATA.;arxiv
6189;The initial seeds for each cluster were normally chosen either sequentially or randomly.;arxiv
6190;The quality of the final clusters was found to be influenced by these initial seeds.;arxiv
6191;For the real life problems, the suitable number of clusters cannot be predicted.;arxiv

6209;Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a powerful technique for discovering whether or not hidden sources are commonly present in two (or more) datasets.;arxiv
6210;Its well-appreciated merits include dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, feature selection, and data fusion.;arxiv
6211;The standard CCA however, does not exploit the geometry of the common sources, which may be available from the given data or can be deduced from (cross-) correlations.;arxiv
6212;In this paper, this extra information provided by the common sources generating the data is encoded in a graph, and is invoked as a graph regularizer.;arxiv

6219;Sparse subspace clustering methods with sparsity induced by $\ell^{0}$-norm, such as $\ell^{0}$-Sparse Subspace Clustering ($\ell^{0}$-SSC)~\citep{YangFJYH16-L0SSC-ijcv}, are demonstrated to be more effective than its $\ell^{1}$ counterpart such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC)~\citep{ElhamifarV13}.;arxiv
6220;However, the theoretical analysis of $\ell^{0}$-SSC is restricted to clean data that lie exactly in subspaces.;arxiv
6221;Real data often suffer from noise and they may lie close to subspaces.;arxiv
6222;In this paper, we show that an optimal solution to the optimization problem of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC achieves subspace detection property (SDP), a key element with which data from different subspaces are separated, under deterministic and semi-random model.;arxiv
6223;Our results provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC in terms of SDP on noisy data for the first time, which reveals the advantage of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC in terms of much less restrictive condition on subspace affinity.;arxiv
6224;In order to improve the efficiency of noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC, we propose Noisy-DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC which provably recovers the subspaces on dimensionality reduced data.;arxiv
6225;Noisy-DR-$\ell^{0}$-SSC first projects the data onto a lower dimensional space by random projection, then performs noisy $\ell^{0}$-SSC on the projected data for improved efficiency.;arxiv

6231;Specially, in smart homes where a large number of IoT devices are used having a secure and trusted mechanisms can provide peace of mind for users.;arxiv
6232;Accurate detection of cyber attacks is crucial, however precise identification of the type of attacks plays a huge role if devising the countermeasure for protecting the system.;arxiv
6233;Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have provided promising results for detecting any security attacks for smart applications.;arxiv
6234;However, due to complex nature of the model used for this technique it is not easy for normal users to trust ANN based security solutions.;arxiv
6235;Also, selection of right hyperparameters for ANN architecture plays a crucial role in the accurate detection of security attacks, especially when it come to identifying the subcategories of attacks.;arxiv
6236;In this paper, we propose a model that considers both the issues of explainability of ANN model and the hyperparameter selection for this approach to be easily trusted and adapted by users of smart home applications.;arxiv

6242;Our algorithm, FixMatch, first generates pseudo-labels using the model's predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled images.;arxiv
6243;For a given image, the pseudo-label is only retained if the model produces a high-confidence prediction.;arxiv
6244;The model is then trained to predict the pseudo-label when fed a strongly-augmented version of the same image.;arxiv
6245;Despite its simplicity, we show that FixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, including 94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels and 88.61% accuracy with 40 -- just 4 labels per class.;arxiv
6246;Since FixMatch bears many similarities to existing SSL methods that achieve worse performance, we carry out an extensive ablation study to tease apart the experimental factors that are most important to FixMatch's success.;arxiv

6249;A standardized set of analysis tools is now needed to identify how network-level covariates -- such as architecture, anatomical brain region, and model organism -- impact neural representations (hidden layer activations).;arxiv
6250;Here, we provide a rigorous foundation for these analyses by defining a broad family of metric spaces that quantify representational dissimilarity.;arxiv
6251;Using this framework we modify existing representational similarity measures based on canonical correlation analysis to satisfy the triangle inequality, formulate a novel metric that respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identify approximate Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method.;arxiv
6252;We demonstrate these methods on large-scale datasets from biology (Allen Institute Brain Observatory) and deep learning (NAS-Bench-101).;arxiv
6253;In doing so, we identify relationships between neural representations that are interpretable in terms of anatomical features and model performance.;arxiv

6255;Our method is computationally efficient and trained only with self-supervised learning on general images, without requiring any adversarial training or retraining of the classification model.;arxiv
6256;We first show an empirical analysis on the adversarial noise, defined to be the residual between an original image and its adversarial example, has almost zero mean, symmetric distribution.;arxiv
6257;Based on this observation, we propose a very simple iterative Gaussian Smoothing (GS) which can effectively smooth out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high robust accuracy.;arxiv
6258;To further improve it, we propose Neural Contextual Iterative Smoothing (NCIS), which trains a blind-spot network (BSN) in a self-supervised manner to reconstruct the discriminative features of the original image that is also smoothed out by GS.;arxiv
6259;From our extensive experiments on the large-scale ImageNet using four classification models, we show that our method achieves both competitive standard accuracy and state-of-the-art robust accuracy against most strong purifier-blind white- and black-box attacks.;arxiv

6264;Early approaches for correspondence placement rely on nearest neighbor search for simpler anatomies.;arxiv
6265;Coordinate transformations for shape correspondence hold promise to address the increasing anatomical complexities.;arxiv
6266;Nonetheless, due to the inherent shape-level geometric complexity and population-level shape variation, the coordinate-wise correspondence often does not translate to the anatomical correspondence.;arxiv
6267;An alternative, group-wise approach for correspondence placement explicitly models the trade-off between geometric description and the population's statistical compactness.;arxiv
6268;However, these models achieve limited success in resolving nonlinear shape correspondence.;arxiv
6269;Recent works have addressed this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of correspondence through lifting positional data to a higher dimensional feature space.;arxiv

6281;ASS systems face many challenges like open grammar, variable pronunciations, and unstructured or semi-structured content.;arxiv
6282;Recent deep learning approaches have shown some promise in this domain.;arxiv
6283;However, most of these approaches focus on extracting features from a single audio, making them suffer from the lack of speaker-specific context required to model such a complex task.;arxiv
6284;We propose a novel deep learning technique for non-native ASS, called speaker-conditioned hierarchical modeling.;arxiv
6285;In our technique, we take advantage of the fact that oral proficiency tests rate multiple responses for a candidate.;arxiv
6286;We extract context vectors from these responses and feed them as additional speaker-specific context to our network to score a particular response.;arxiv
6287;We compare our technique with strong baselines and find that such modeling improves the model's average performance by 6.92% (maximum = 12.86%, minimum = 4.51%).;arxiv
6288;We further show both quantitative and qualitative insights into the importance of this additional context in solving the problem of ASS.;arxiv

6291;We analyze the convergence rate of our algorithm assuming that the data is indeed generated according to this model (as well as additional assumptions).;arxiv
6292;While we do not pretend to claim that the assumptions are realistic for natural images, we do believe that they capture some true properties of real data.;arxiv
6293;Furthermore, we show that our algorithm actually works in practice (on the CIFAR dataset), achieving results in the same ballpark as that of vanilla convolutional neural networks that are being trained by stochastic gradient descent.;arxiv
6294;Finally, our proof techniques may be of independent interest.;arxiv

6303;This general idea is explored in detail for the focused case of AL with cost-weighted SVMs for imbalanced data, a situation that arises for many HLT tasks.;arxiv
6304;The key idea behind the proposed InitPA method for addressing imbalance is to base cost models during AL on an estimate of overall corpus imbalance computed via a small unbiased sample rather than the imbalance in the labeled training data, which is the leading method used during PL.;arxiv
6305;Weight sharing based and predictor based methods are two major types of fast neural architecture search methods.;arxiv
6306;In this paper, we propose to jointly use weight sharing and predictor in a unified framework.;arxiv
6307;First, we construct a SuperNet in a weight-sharing way and probabilisticly sample architectures from the SuperNet.;arxiv
6308;To increase the correctness of the evaluation of architectures, besides direct evaluation using the inherited weights, we further apply a few-shot predictor to assess the architecture on the other hand.;arxiv
6309;The final evaluation of the architecture is the combination of direct evaluation, the prediction from the predictor and the cost of the architecture.;arxiv
6310;We regard the evaluation as a reward and apply a self-critical policy gradient approach to update the architecture probabilities.;arxiv

6315;In a belief network, the method estimates an approximate factorized posterior of all hidden units given the input.;arxiv
6316;In neural networks the method propagates uncertainty of the input through all the layers.;arxiv
6317;In neural networks with injected noise, the method analytically takes into account uncertainties resulting from this noise.;arxiv
6318;Such feed-forward analytic propagation is differentiable in parameters and can be trained end-to-end.;arxiv
6319;Compared to standard NN, which can be viewed as propagating only the means, we propagate the mean and variance.;arxiv
6320;The method can be useful in all scenarios that require knowledge of the neuron statistics, e.g. when dealing with uncertain inputs, considering sigmoid activations as probabilities of Bernoulli units, training the models regularized by injected noise (dropout) or estimating activation statistics over the dataset (as needed for normalization methods).;arxiv
6321;In the experiments we show the possible utility of the method in all these tasks as well as its current limitations.;arxiv
6322;The notion of approachability in repeated games with vector payoffs was introduced by Blackwell in the 1950s, along with geometric conditions for approachability and corresponding strategies that rely on computing {\em steering directions} as projections from the current average payoff vector to the (convex) target set.;arxiv
6323;Recently, Abernethy, Batlett and Hazan (2011) proposed a class of approachability algorithms that rely on the no-regret properties of Online Linear Programming for computing a suitable sequence of steering directions.;arxiv
6324;This is first carried out for target sets that are convex cones, and then generalized to any convex set by embedding it in a higher-dimensional convex cone.;arxiv
6325;In this paper we present a more direct formulation that relies on the support function of the set, along with suitable Online Convex Optimization algorithms, which leads to a general class of approachability algorithms.;arxiv

6352;Practical brain-machine interfaces have been widely studied to accurately detect human intentions using brain signals in the real world.;arxiv
6353;However, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals are distorted owing to the artifacts such as walking and head movement, so brain signals may be large in amplitude rather than desired EEG signals.;arxiv
6354;Due to these artifacts, detecting accurately human intention in the mobile environment is challenging.;arxiv
6355;In this paper, we proposed the reconstruction framework based on generative adversarial networks using the event-related potentials (ERP) during walking.;arxiv
6356;We used a pre-trained convolutional encoder to represent latent variables and reconstructed ERP through the generative model which shape similar to the opposite of encoder.;arxiv
6357;Finally, the ERP was classified using the discriminative model to demonstrate the validity of our proposed framework.;arxiv

6364;Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful dynamical models for data with complex temporal structure.;arxiv
6365;However, training RNNs has traditionally proved challenging due to exploding or vanishing of gradients.;arxiv
6366;RNN models such as LSTMs and GRUs (and their variants) significantly mitigate these issues associated with training by introducing various types of gating units into the architecture.;arxiv
6367;While these gates empirically improve performance, how the addition of gates influences the dynamics and trainability of GRUs and LSTMs is not well understood.;arxiv
6368;Here, we take the perspective of studying randomly initialized LSTMs and GRUs as dynamical systems, and ask how the salient dynamical properties are shaped by the gates.;arxiv
6369;We leverage tools from random matrix theory and mean-field theory to study the state-to-state Jacobians of GRUs and LSTMs.;arxiv
6370;We show that the update gate in the GRU and the forget gate in the LSTM can lead to an accumulation of slow modes in the dynamics.;arxiv
6371;Moreover, the GRU update gate can poise the system at a marginally stable point.;arxiv
6372;The reset gate in the GRU and the output and input gates in the LSTM control the spectral radius of the Jacobian, and the GRU reset gate also modulates the complexity of the landscape of fixed-points.;arxiv

6493;This paper proposes a differentiable linear quadratic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for safe imitation learning.;arxiv
6494;The infinite-horizon cost is enforced using a terminal cost function obtained from the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE), so that the learned controller can be proven to be stabilizing in closed-loop.;arxiv
6495;A central contribution is the derivation of the analytical derivative of the solution of the DARE, thereby allowing the use of differentiation-based learning methods.;arxiv
6496;A further contribution is the structure of the MPC optimization problem: an augmented Lagrangian method ensures that the MPC optimization is feasible throughout training whilst enforcing hard constraints on state and input, and a pre-stabilizing controller ensures that the MPC solution and derivatives are accurate at each iteration.;arxiv
6497;The learning capabilities of the framework are demonstrated in a set of numerical studies.;arxiv
6498;Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming more prevalent in important safety-critical applications, where reliability in the prediction is paramount.;arxiv
6499;Despite their exceptional prediction capabilities, current DNNs do not have an implicit mechanism to quantify and propagate significant input data uncertainty -- which is common in safety-critical applications.;arxiv
6500;In many cases, this uncertainty is epistemic and can arise from multiple sources, such as lack of knowledge about the data generating process, imprecision, ignorance, and poor understanding of physics phenomena.;arxiv
6501;Recent approaches have focused on quantifying parameter uncertainty, but approaches to end-to-end training of DNNs with epistemic input data uncertainty are more limited and largely problem-specific.;arxiv
6502;In this work, we present a DNN optimized with gradient-based methods capable to quantify input and parameter uncertainty by means of interval analysis, which we call Deep Interval Neural Network (DINN).;arxiv
6503;We perform experiments on an air pollution dataset with sensor uncertainty and show that the DINN can produce accurate bounded estimates from uncertain input data.;arxiv

6506;We then apply our results to construct a consistent modal regression algorithm.;arxiv
6507;GANs are well known for success in the realistic image generation.;arxiv
6508;However, they can be applied in tabular data generation as well.;arxiv
6509;We will review and examine some recent papers about tabular GANs in action.;arxiv
6510;We will generate data to make train distribution bring closer to the test.;arxiv
6511;Then compare model performance trained on the initial train dataset, with trained on the train with GAN generated data, also we train the model by sampling train by adversarial training.;arxiv
6512;We show that using GAN might be an option in case of uneven data distribution between train and test data.;arxiv
6513;Iconography in art is the discipline that studies the visual content of artworks to determine their motifs and themes andto characterize the way these are represented.;arxiv
6514;It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes, including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences across artists and art works.;arxiv
6515;With the proliferation of digital archives of art images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography research and education.;arxiv
6516;In this paper we introduce a novel paintings data set for iconography classification and present the quantitativeand qualitative results of applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to the recognition of the iconography of artworks.;arxiv
6517;The proposed classifier achieves good performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score and 72.73% Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar visual features.;arxiv
6518;Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification.;arxiv
6519;The ultimate goal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and comparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and automatic art work annotation.;arxiv
6520;Distant supervision (DS) is a strong way to expand the datasets for enhancing relation extraction (RE) models but often suffers from high label noise.;arxiv
6521;Current works based on attention, reinforcement learning, or GAN are black-box models so they neither provide meaningful interpretation of sample selection in DS nor stability on different domains.;arxiv
6522;On the contrary, this work proposes a novel model-agnostic instance sampling method for DS by influence function (IF), namely REIF.;arxiv
6523;Our method identifies favorable/unfavorable instances in the bag based on IF, then does dynamic instance sampling.;arxiv
6524;We design a fast influence sampling algorithm that reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, with analyzing its robustness on the selected sampling function.;arxiv
6525;Experiments show that by simply sampling the favorable instances during training, REIF is able to win over a series of baselines that have complicated architectures.;arxiv
6526;We also demonstrate that REIF can support interpretable instance selection.;arxiv
6527;A powerful and flexible approach to structured prediction consists in embedding the structured objects to be predicted into a feature space of possibly infinite dimension by means of output kernels, and then, solving a regression problem in this output space.;arxiv
6528;A prediction in the original space is computed by solving a pre-image problem.;arxiv
6529;In such an approach, the embedding, linked to the target loss, is defined prior to the learning phase.;arxiv
6530;In this work, we propose to jointly learn a finite approximation of the output embedding and the regression function into the new feature space.;arxiv
6531;For that purpose, we leverage a priori information on the outputs and also unexploited unsupervised output data, which are both often available in structured prediction problems.;arxiv
6532;We prove that the resulting structured predictor is a consistent estimator, and derive an excess risk bound.;arxiv
6533;Moreover, the novel structured prediction tool enjoys a significantly smaller computational complexity than former output kernel methods.;arxiv
6534;The approach empirically tested on various structured prediction problems reveals to be versatile and able to handle large datasets.;arxiv
6535;Traditional neural language models tend to generate generic replies with poor logic and no emotion.;arxiv
6536;In this paper, a syntactically constrained bidirectional-asynchronous approach for emotional conversation generation (E-SCBA) is proposed to address this issue.;arxiv
6537;In our model, pre-generated emotion keywords and topic keywords are asynchronously introduced into the process of decoding.;arxiv
6538;It is much different from most existing methods which generate replies from the first word to the last.;arxiv
6539;Through experiments, the results indicate that our approach not only improves the diversity of replies, but gains a boost on both logic and emotion compared with baselines.;arxiv
6540;The over-parameterized models attract much attention in the era of data science and deep learning.;arxiv
6541;It is empirically observed that although these models, e.g. deep neural networks, over-fit the training data, they can still achieve small testing error, and sometimes even {\em outperform} traditional algorithms which are designed to avoid over-fitting.;arxiv
6542;The major goal of this work is to sharply quantify the benefit of data interpolation in the context of nearest neighbors (NN) algorithm.;arxiv
6543;Specifically, we consider a class of interpolated weighting schemes and then carefully characterize their asymptotic performances.;arxiv
6544;Our analysis reveals a U-shaped performance curve with respect to the level of data interpolation, and proves that a mild degree of data interpolation {\em strictly} improves the prediction accuracy and statistical stability over those of the (un-interpolated) optimal $k$NN algorithm.;arxiv
6545;This theoretically justifies (predicts) the existence of the second U-shaped curve in the recently discovered double descent phenomenon.;arxiv
6546;Note that our goal in this study is not to promote the use of interpolated-NN method, but to obtain theoretical insights on data interpolation inspired by the aforementioned phenomenon.;arxiv
6547;Personalized medicine, a paradigm of medicine tailored to a patient's characteristics, is an increasingly attractive field in health care.;arxiv
6548;An important goal of personalized medicine is to identify a subgroup of patients, based on baseline covariates, that benefits more from the targeted treatment than other comparative treatments.;arxiv
6549;Most of the current subgroup identification methods only focus on obtaining a subgroup with an enhanced treatment effect without paying attention to subgroup size.;arxiv
6550;Yet, a clinically meaningful subgroup learning approach should identify the maximum number of patients who can benefit from the better treatment.;arxiv
6551;In this paper, we present an optimal subgroup selection rule (SSR) that maximizes the number of selected patients, and in the meantime, achieves the pre-specified clinically meaningful mean outcome, such as the average treatment effect.;arxiv
6552;We derive two equivalent theoretical forms of the optimal SSR based on the contrast function that describes the treatment-covariates interaction in the outcome.;arxiv
6553;We further propose a ConstrAined PolIcy Tree seArch aLgorithm (CAPITAL) to find the optimal SSR within the interpretable decision tree class.;arxiv
6554;The proposed method is flexible to handle multiple constraints that penalize the inclusion of patients with negative treatment effects, and to address time to event data using the restricted mean survival time as the clinically interesting mean outcome.;arxiv
6555;Extensive simulations, comparison studies, and real data applications are conducted to demonstrate the validity and utility of our method.;arxiv
6556;Representation learning on graphs has been gaining attention due to its wide applicability in predicting missing links, and classifying and recommending nodes.;arxiv
6557;Most embedding methods aim to preserve certain properties of the original graph in the low dimensional space.;arxiv
6558;However, real world graphs have a combination of several properties which are difficult to characterize and capture by a single approach.;arxiv
6559;In this work, we introduce the problem of graph representation ensemble learning and provide a first of its kind framework to aggregate multiple graph embedding methods efficiently.;arxiv
6560;We provide analysis of our framework and analyze -- theoretically and empirically -- the dependence between state-of-the-art embedding methods.;arxiv
6561;We test our models on the node classification task on four real world graphs and show that proposed ensemble approaches can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by up to 8% on macro-F1.;arxiv
6562;We further show that the approach is even more beneficial for underrepresented classes providing an improvement of up to 12%.;arxiv
6563;We develop a general framework for proving rigorous guarantees on the performance of the EM algorithm and a variant known as gradient EM.;arxiv
6564;Our analysis is divided into two parts: a treatment of these algorithms at the population level (in the limit of infinite data), followed by results that apply to updates based on a finite set of samples.;arxiv
6565;First, we characterize the domain of attraction of any global maximizer of the population likelihood.;arxiv
6566;This characterization is based on a novel view of the EM updates as a perturbed form of likelihood ascent, or in parallel, of the gradient EM updates as a perturbed form of standard gradient ascent.;arxiv
6567;Leveraging this characterization, we then provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the EM and gradient EM algorithms when applied to a finite set of samples.;arxiv
6568;We develop consequences of our general theory for three canonical examples of incomplete-data problems: mixture of Gaussians, mixture of regressions, and linear regression with covariates missing completely at random.;arxiv
6569;In each case, our theory guarantees that with a suitable initialization, a relatively small number of EM (or gradient EM) steps will yield (with high probability) an estimate that is within statistical error of the MLE.;arxiv
6570;We provide simulations to confirm this theoretically predicted behavior.;arxiv
6571;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained considerable interest due to their energy-efficient characteristics, yet lack of a scalable training algorithm has restricted their applicability in practical machine learning problems.;arxiv
6572;The deep neural network-to-SNN conversion approach has been widely studied to broaden the applicability of SNNs.;arxiv
6573;Most previous studies, however, have not fully utilized spatio-temporal aspects of SNNs, which has led to inefficiency in terms of number of spikes and inference latency.;arxiv
6574;In this paper, we present T2FSNN, which introduces the concept of time-to-first-spike coding into deep SNNs using the kernel-based dynamic threshold and dendrite to overcome the aforementioned drawback.;arxiv
6575;In addition, we propose gradient-based optimization and early firing methods to further increase the efficiency of the T2FSNN.;arxiv
6576;According to our results, the proposed methods can reduce inference latency and number of spikes to 22% and less than 1%, compared to those of burst coding, which is the state-of-the-art result on the CIFAR-100.;arxiv
6577;Recently over-smoothing phenomenon of Transformer-based models is observed in both vision and language fields.;arxiv
6578;However, no existing work has delved deeper to further investigate the main cause of this phenomenon.;arxiv
6579;In this work, we make the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored.;arxiv
6580;Intuitively, the self-attention matrix can be seen as a normalized adjacent matrix of a corresponding graph.;arxiv
6581;Based on the above connection, we provide some theoretical analysis and find that layer normalization plays a key role in the over-smoothing issue of Transformer-based models.;arxiv
6582;Specifically, if the standard deviation of layer normalization is sufficiently large, the output of Transformer stacks will converge to a specific low-rank subspace and result in over-smoothing.;arxiv
6583;To alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we consider hierarchical fusion strategies, which combine the representations from different layers adaptively to make the output more diverse.;arxiv
6584;Extensive experiment results on various data sets illustrate the effect of our fusion method.;arxiv
6585;The challenge consists of four question-answering tasks based on radiology images.;arxiv
6586;The diversity of imaging modalities, organs and disease types combined with a small imbalanced training set made this a highly complex problem.;arxiv
6587;To overcome these difficulties, we implemented a modular pipeline architecture that utilized transfer learning and multi-task learning.;arxiv
6588;Our findings led to the development of a novel model called Supporting Facts Network (SFN).;arxiv
6589;The main idea behind SFN is to cross-utilize information from upstream tasks to improve the accuracy on harder downstream ones.;arxiv
6590;This approach significantly improved the scores achieved in the validation set (18 point improvement in F-1 score).;arxiv
6591;Finally, we submitted four runs to the competition and were ranked seventh.;arxiv
6592;In this paper, we propose a method to distinguish spurious and genuine correlations in text classification.;arxiv
6593;"We treat this as a supervised classification problem, using features derived from treatment effect estimators to distinguish spurious correlations from ""genuine"" ones.";arxiv
6594;Due to the generic nature of these features and their small dimensionality, we find that the approach works well even with limited training examples, and that it is possible to transport the word classifier to new domains.;arxiv
6595;We propose a novel solution for the Register Allocation problem, leveraging multi-agent hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.;arxiv
6596;We formalize the constraints that precisely define the problem for a given instruction-set architecture, while ensuring that the generated code preserves semantic correctness.;arxiv
6597;We also develop a gRPC based framework providing a modular and efficient compiler interface for training and inference.;arxiv
6598;Experimental results match or outperform the LLVM register allocators, targeting Intel x86 and ARM AArch64.;arxiv
6599;Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied for improving sequence-generation models.;arxiv
6600;However, the conventional rewards used for RL training typically cannot capture sufficient semantic information and therefore render model bias.;arxiv
6601;Further, the sparse and delayed rewards make RL exploration inefficient.;arxiv
6602;To alleviate these issues, we propose the concept of nested-Wasserstein distance for distributional semantic matching.;arxiv
6603;To further exploit it, a novel nested-Wasserstein self-imitation learning framework is developed, encouraging the model to exploit historical high-rewarded sequences for enhanced exploration and better semantic matching.;arxiv
6604;Our solution can be understood as approximately executing proximal policy optimization with Wasserstein trust-regions.;arxiv
6605;Experiments on a variety of unconditional and conditional sequence-generation tasks demonstrate the proposed approach consistently leads to improved performance.;arxiv
6606;A deep-learning-based hybrid strategy for short-term load forecasting is presented.;arxiv
6607;The strategy proposes a novel tree-based ensemble method Warm-start Gradient Tree Boosting (WGTB).;arxiv
6608;Current strategies either ensemble submodels of a single type, which fail to take advantage of the statistical strengths of different inference models.;arxiv
6609;Or they simply sum the outputs from completely different inference models, which doesn't maximize the potential of ensemble.;arxiv
6610;Inspired by the bias-variance trade-off, WGTB is proposed and tailored to the great disparity among different inference models on accuracy, volatility and linearity.;arxiv
6611;The complete strategy integrates four different inference models of different capacities.;arxiv
6612;WGTB then ensembles their outputs by a warm-start and a hybrid of bagging and boosting, which lowers bias and variance concurrently.;arxiv
6613;It is validated on two real datasets from State Grid Corporation of China of hourly resolution.;arxiv
6614;The result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy that hybridizes the statistical strengths of both low-bias and low-variance inference models.;arxiv
6615;DeepTingle is a text prediction and classification system trained on the collected works of the renowned fantastic gay erotica author Chuck Tingle.;arxiv
6616;"Whereas the writing assistance tools you use everyday (in the form of predictive text, translation, grammar checking and so on) are trained on generic, purportedly ""neutral"" datasets, DeepTingle is trained on a very specific, internally consistent but externally arguably eccentric dataset.";arxiv
6617;This allows us to foreground and confront the norms embedded in data-driven creativity and productivity assistance tools.;arxiv
6618;As such tools effectively function as extensions of our cognition into technology, it is important to identify the norms they embed within themselves and, by extension, us.;arxiv
6619;DeepTingle is realized as a web application based on LSTM networks and the GloVe word embedding, implemented in JavaScript with Keras-JS.;arxiv
6620;Neural networks used for multi-interaction trajectory reconstruction lack the ability to estimate the uncertainty in their outputs, which would be useful to better analyse and understand the systems they model.;arxiv
6621;In this paper we extend the Factorised Neural Relational Inference model to output both a mean and a standard deviation for each component of the phase space vector, which together with an appropriate loss function, can account for uncertainty.;arxiv
6622;A variety of loss functions are investigated including ideas from convexification and a Bayesian treatment of the problem.;arxiv
6623;We show that the physical meaning of the variables is important when considering the uncertainty and demonstrate the existence of pathological local minima that are difficult to avoid during training.;arxiv
6624;Every natural text is written in some style.;arxiv
6625;One cannot form a complete understanding of a text without considering these factors.;arxiv
6626;The factors combine and co-vary in complex ways to form styles.;arxiv
6627;Studying the nature of the co-varying combinations sheds light on stylistic language in general, sometimes called cross-style language understanding.;arxiv
6628;The benchmark contains text in 15 different styles under the proposed four theoretical groupings: figurative, personal, affective, and interpersonal groups.;arxiv
6629;For valid evaluation, we collect an additional diagnostic set by annotating all 15 styles on the same text.;arxiv
6630;Using xSLUE, we propose three interesting cross-style applications in classification, correlation, and generation.;arxiv
6631;First, our proposed cross-style classifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall classification performance against individually-trained style classifiers.;arxiv
6632;Second, our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in human-written text.;arxiv
6633;Finally, we find that combinations of some contradictive styles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text.;arxiv
6634;We believe our benchmark and case studies help explore interesting future directions for cross-style research.;arxiv
6635;The preprocessed datasets and code are publicly available.;arxiv
6636;Deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs).;arxiv
6637;It is commonly assumed that tumor regions carry most predictive information.;arxiv
6638;In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised clustering-based multiple-instance learning, and apply our method to develop deep-learning models for prediction of gene mutations using WSIs from three cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (CRC, LUAD, and HNSCC).;arxiv
6639;We showed that unsupervised clustering of image patches could help identify predictive patches, exclude patches lack of predictive information, and therefore improve prediction on gene mutations in all three different cancer types, compared with the WSI based method without selection of image patches and models based on only tumor regions.;arxiv
6640;Additionally, our proposed algorithm outperformed two recently published baseline algorithms leveraging unsupervised clustering to assist model prediction.;arxiv
6641;The unsupervised-clustering-based approach for mutation prediction allows identification of the spatial regions related to mutation of a specific gene via the resolved probability scores, highlighting the heterogeneity of a predicted genotype in the tumor microenvironment.;arxiv
6642;Finally, our study also demonstrated that selection of tumor regions of WSIs is not always the best way to identify patches for prediction of gene mutations, and other tissue types in the tumor micro-environment may provide better prediction ability for gene mutations than tumor tissues.;arxiv
6643;Given a gallery of uncaptioned video sequences, this paper considers the task of retrieving videos based on their relevance to an unseen text query.;arxiv
6644;To compensate for the lack of annotations, we rely instead on a related video gallery composed of video-caption pairs, termed the source gallery, albeit with a domain gap between its videos and those in the target gallery.;arxiv
6645;We thus introduce the problem of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-modal Video Retrieval, along with a new benchmark on fine-grained actions.;arxiv
6646;Our approach adapts the embedding space to the target gallery, consistently outperforming source-only as well as marginal and conditional alignment methods.;arxiv
6647;An increasing number of machine learning models have been deployed in domains with high stakes such as finance and healthcare.;arxiv
6648;Despite their superior performances, many models are black boxes in nature which are hard to explain.;arxiv
6649;There are growing efforts for researchers to develop methods to interpret these black-box models.;arxiv
6650;Post hoc explanations based on perturbations, such as LIME, are widely used approaches to interpret a machine learning model after it has been built.;arxiv
6651;This class of methods has been shown to exhibit large instability, posing serious challenges to the effectiveness of the method itself and harming user trust.;arxiv
6652;In this paper, we propose S-LIME, which utilizes a hypothesis testing framework based on central limit theorem for determining the number of perturbation points needed to guarantee stability of the resulting explanation.;arxiv
6653;Experiments on both simulated and real world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.;arxiv
6654;"We propose a decentralised ""local2global"" approach to graph representation learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique.";arxiv
6655;"Our local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into overlapping subgraphs (or ""patches"") and training local representations for each patch independently.";arxiv
6656;In a second step, we combine the local representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization.;arxiv
6657;A key distinguishing feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation during distributed training.;arxiv
6658;This allows local2global to scale to large-scale industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and may be stored in a distributed manner.;arxiv
6659;Preliminary results on medium-scale data sets (up to $\sim$7K nodes and $\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph reconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of globally trained embeddings.;arxiv
6660;A thorough evaluation of local2global on large scale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, constitutes ongoing work.;arxiv
6661;The accuracy of deep neural networks is degraded when the distribution of features in the test environment (target domain) differs from that of the training (source) environment.;arxiv
6662;To mitigate the degradation, test-time adaptation (TTA), where a model adapts to the target domain without access to the source dataset, can be used in the test environment.;arxiv
6663;However, the existing TTA methods lack feature distribution alignment between the source and target domains, which unsupervised domain adaptation mainly addresses, because accessing the source dataset is prohibited in the TTA setting.;arxiv
6664;In this paper, we propose a novel TTA method, named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe), which explicitly aligns the source and target feature distributions at test time.;arxiv
6665;To perform alignment without accessing the source data, CAFe uses auxiliary feature statistics (mean and covariance) pre-computed on the source domain, which are lightweight and easily prepared.;arxiv
6666;Further, to improve efficiency and stability, we propose feature grouping, which splits the feature dimensions into groups according to their correlations by using spectral clustering to avoid degeneration of the covariance matrix.;arxiv
6667;We empirically show that CAFe outperforms prior TTA methods on a variety of distribution shifts.;arxiv
6668;In this expository note we describe a surprising phenomenon in overparameterized linear regression, where the dimension exceeds the number of samples: there is a regime where the test risk of the estimator found by gradient descent increases with additional samples.;arxiv
6669;In other words, more data actually hurts the estimator.;arxiv
6670;"This behavior is implicit in a recent line of theoretical works analyzing ""double-descent"" phenomenon in linear models.";arxiv
6671;In this note, we isolate and understand this behavior in an extremely simple setting: linear regression with isotropic Gaussian covariates.;arxiv
6672;In particular, this occurs due to an unconventional type of bias-variance tradeoff in the overparameterized regime: the bias decreases with more samples, but variance increases.;arxiv
6673;Solving symbolic mathematics has always been of in the arena of human ingenuity that needs compositional reasoning and recurrence.;arxiv
6674;However, recent studies have shown that large-scale language models such as transformers are universal and surprisingly can be trained as a sequence-to-sequence task to solve complex mathematical equations.;arxiv
6675;These large transformer models need humongous amounts of training data to generalize to unseen symbolic mathematics problems.;arxiv
6676;In this paper, we present a sample efficient way of solving the symbolic tasks by first pretraining the transformer model with language translation and then fine-tuning the pretrained transformer model to solve the downstream task of symbolic mathematics.;arxiv
6677;We achieve comparable accuracy on the integration task with our pretrained model while using around $1.5$ orders of magnitude less number of training samples with respect to the state-of-the-art deep learning for symbolic mathematics.;arxiv
6678;The test accuracy on differential equation tasks is considerably lower comparing with integration as they need higher order recursions that are not present in language translations.;arxiv
6679;We pretrain our model with different pairs of language translations.;arxiv
6680;Our results show language bias in solving symbolic mathematics tasks.;arxiv
6681;Finally, we study the robustness of the fine-tuned model on symbolic math tasks against distribution shift, and our approach generalizes better in distribution shift scenarios for the function integration.;arxiv
6682;The diagnosis process of colorectal cancer mainly focuses on the localization and characterization of abnormal growths in the colon tissue known as polyps.;arxiv
6683;Despite recent advances in deep object localization, the localization of polyps remains challenging due to the similarities between tissues, and the high level of artifacts.;arxiv
6684;Recent studies have shown the negative impact of the presence of artifacts in the polyp detection task, and have started to take them into account within the training process.;arxiv
6685;However, the use of prior knowledge related to the spatial interaction of polyps and artifacts has not yet been considered.;arxiv
6686;In this work, we incorporate artifact knowledge in a post-processing step.;arxiv
6687;Our method models this task as an inductive graph representation learning problem, and is composed of training and inference steps.;arxiv
6688;Detected bounding boxes around polyps and artifacts are considered as nodes connected by a defined criterion.;arxiv
6689;The training step generates a node classifier with ground truth bounding boxes.;arxiv
6690;In inference, we use this classifier to analyze a second graph, generated from artifact and polyp predictions given by region proposal networks.;arxiv
6691;We evaluate how the choices in the connectivity and artifacts affect the performance of our method and show that it has the potential to reduce the false positives in the results of a region proposal network.;arxiv
6692;This leads to erroneous user preference estimates, namely, overestimation of over-presented content while violating the right to be presented of each alternative, contrary of which we define as a fair system.;arxiv
6693;We consider two models that explicitly incorporate, or ignore the systematic and limited exposure to alternatives.;arxiv
6694;By simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the systematic presentations overestimates promoted options and underestimates censored alternatives.;arxiv
6695;Simply conditioning on the limited exposure is a remedy for these biases.;arxiv
6696;We investigate the problem of truth discovery based on opinions from multiple agents who may be unreliable or biased.;arxiv
6697;We consider the case where agents' reliabilities or biases are correlated if they belong to the same community, which defines a group of agents with similar opinions regarding a particular event.;arxiv
6698;We incorporate knowledge of the agents' social network in our truth discovery framework and develop Laplace variational inference methods to estimate agents' reliabilities, communities, and the event states.;arxiv
6699;We also develop a stochastic variational inference method to scale our model to large social networks.;arxiv
6700;Simulations and experiments on real data suggest that when observations are sparse, our proposed methods perform better than several other inference methods, including majority voting, TruthFinder, AccuSim, the Confidence-Aware Truth Discovery method, the Bayesian Classifier Combination (BCC) method, and the Community BCC method.;arxiv
6701;Split-Merge MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) is one of the essential and popular variants of MCMC for problems when an MCMC state consists of an unknown number of components.;arxiv
6702;It is well known that state-of-the-art methods for split-merge MCMC do not scale well.;arxiv
6703;Strategies for rapid mixing requires smart and informative proposals to reduce the rejection rate.;arxiv
6704;However, all known smart proposals involve expensive operations to suggest informative transitions.;arxiv
6705;As a result, the cost of each iteration is prohibitive for massive scale datasets.;arxiv
6706;It is further known that uninformative but computationally efficient proposals, such as random split-merge, leads to extremely slow convergence.;arxiv
6707;This tradeoff between mixing time and per update cost seems hard to get around.;arxiv
6708;In this paper, we show a sweet spot.;arxiv
6709;We leverage some unique properties of weighted MinHash, which is a popular LSH, to design a novel class of split-merge proposals which are significantly more informative than random sampling but at the same time efficient to compute.;arxiv
6710;Overall, we obtain a superior tradeoff between convergence and per update cost.;arxiv

6712;We present a CLSRIL-23, a self supervised learning based audio pre-trained model which learns cross lingual speech representations from raw audio across 23 Indic languages.;arxiv
6713;It is built on top of wav2vec 2.0 which is solved by training a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and jointly learns the quantization of latents shared across all languages.;arxiv
6714;We compare the language wise loss during pretraining to compare effects of monolingual and multilingual pretraining.;arxiv
6715;Performance on some downstream fine-tuning tasks for speech recognition is also compared and our experiments show that multilingual pretraining outperforms monolingual training, in terms of learning speech representations which encodes phonetic similarity of languages and also in terms of performance on down stream tasks.;arxiv
6716;A decrease of 5% is observed in WER and 9.5% in CER when a multilingual pretrained model is used for finetuning in Hindi.;arxiv
6717;All the code models are also open sourced.;arxiv
6718;CLSRIL-23 is a model trained on $23$ languages and almost 10,000 hours of audio data to facilitate research in speech recognition for Indic languages.;arxiv
6719;We hope that new state of the art systems will be created using the self supervised approach, especially for low resources Indic languages.;arxiv
6720;Label space expansion for multi-label classification (MLC) is a methodology that encodes the original label vectors to higher dimensional codes before training and decodes the predicted codes back to the label vectors during testing.;arxiv
6721;The methodology has been demonstrated to improve the performance of MLC algorithms when coupled with off-the-shelf error-correcting codes for encoding and decoding.;arxiv
6722;Nevertheless, such a coding scheme can be complicated to implement, and cannot easily satisfy a common application need of cost-sensitive MLC---adapting to different evaluation criteria of interest.;arxiv
6723;In this work, we show that a simpler coding scheme based on the concept of a reference pair of label vectors achieves cost-sensitivity more naturally.;arxiv
6724;In particular, our proposed cost-sensitive reference pair encoding (CSRPE) algorithm contains cluster-based encoding, weight-based training and voting-based decoding steps, all utilizing the cost information.;arxiv
6725;Furthermore, we leverage the cost information embedded in the code space of CSRPE to propose a novel active learning algorithm for cost-sensitive MLC.;arxiv
6726;Extensive experimental results verify that CSRPE performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms across different MLC criteria.;arxiv
6727;The results also demonstrate that the CSRPE-backed active learning algorithm is superior to existing algorithms for active MLC, and further justify the usefulness of CSRPE.;arxiv
6728;Sparse R-CNN is a recent strong object detection baseline by set prediction on sparse, learnable proposal boxes and proposal features.;arxiv
6729;In this work, we propose to improve Sparse R-CNN with two dynamic designs.;arxiv
6730;First, Sparse R-CNN adopts a one-to-one label assignment scheme, where the Hungarian algorithm is applied to match only one positive sample for each ground truth.;arxiv
6731;Such one-to-one assignment may not be optimal for the matching between the learned proposal boxes and ground truths.;arxiv
6732;To address this problem, we propose dynamic label assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm to assign increasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN.;arxiv
6733;We constrain the matching to be gradually looser in the sequential stages as the later stage produces the refined proposals with improved precision.;arxiv
6734;Second, the learned proposal boxes and features remain fixed for different images in the inference process of Sparse R-CNN.;arxiv
6735;Motivated by dynamic convolution, we propose dynamic proposal generation (DPG) to assemble multiple proposal experts dynamically for providing better initial proposal boxes and features for the consecutive training stages.;arxiv
6736;DPG thereby can derive sample-dependent proposal boxes and features for inference.;arxiv
6737;Experiments demonstrate that our method, named Dynamic Sparse R-CNN, can boost the strong Sparse R-CNN baseline with different backbones for object detection.;arxiv
6738;Particularly, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN reaches the state-of-the-art 47.2% AP on the COCO 2017 validation set, surpassing Sparse R-CNN by 2.2% AP with the same ResNet-50 backbone.;arxiv
6739;End-to-end Speech Translation (ST) models have many potential advantages when compared to the cascade of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and text Machine Translation (MT) models, including lowered inference latency and the avoidance of error compounding.;arxiv
6740;However, the quality of end-to-end ST is often limited by a paucity of training data, since it is difficult to collect large parallel corpora of speech and translated transcript pairs.;arxiv
6741;Previous studies have proposed the use of pre-trained components and multi-task learning in order to benefit from weakly supervised training data, such as speech-to-transcript or text-to-foreign-text pairs.;arxiv
6742;In this paper, we demonstrate that using pre-trained MT or text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models to convert weakly supervised data into speech-to-translation pairs for ST training can be more effective than multi-task learning.;arxiv
6743;Furthermore, we demonstrate that a high quality end-to-end ST model can be trained using only weakly supervised datasets, and that synthetic data sourced from unlabeled monolingual text or speech can be used to improve performance.;arxiv
6744;Finally, we discuss methods for avoiding overfitting to synthetic speech with a quantitative ablation study.;arxiv
6745;We train multi-task autoencoders on linguistic tasks and analyze the learned hidden sentence representations.;arxiv
6746;The representations change significantly when translation and part-of-speech decoders are added.;arxiv
6747;The more decoders a model employs, the better it clusters sentences according to their syntactic similarity, as the representation space becomes less entangled.;arxiv
6748;We explore the structure of the representation space by interpolating between sentences, which yields interesting pseudo-English sentences, many of which have recognizable syntactic structure.;arxiv
6749;Lastly, we point out an interesting property of our models: The difference-vector between two sentences can be added to change a third sentence with similar features in a meaningful way.;arxiv
6750;Hyperbolic-spaces are better suited to represent data with underlying hierarchical relationships, e.g., tree-like data.;arxiv
6751;However, it is often necessary to incorporate, through alignment, different but related representations meaningfully.;arxiv
6752;This aligning is an important class of machine learning problems, with applications as ontology matching and cross-lingual alignment.;arxiv
6753;Optimal transport (OT)-based approaches are a natural choice to tackle the alignment problem as they aim to find a transformation of the source dataset to match a target dataset, subject to some distribution constraints.;arxiv
6754;This work proposes a novel approach based on OT of embeddings on the Poincar\'e model of hyperbolic spaces.;arxiv
6755;"Our method relies on the gyrobarycenter mapping on M\""obius gyrovector spaces.";arxiv
6756;As a result of this formalism, we derive extensions to some existing Euclidean methods of OT-based domain adaptation to their hyperbolic counterparts.;arxiv
6757;Empirically, we show that both Euclidean and hyperbolic methods have similar performances in the context of retrieval.;arxiv
6758;Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context.;arxiv
6759;We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code.;arxiv
6760;Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model.;arxiv
6761;We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages.;arxiv
6762;Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code.;arxiv
6763;Meta-learning aims at optimizing the hyperparameters of a model class or training algorithm from the observation of data from a number of related tasks.;arxiv
6764;The statistical properties of the task environment thus dictate the similarity of the tasks.;arxiv
6765;The goal of the meta-learner is to ensure that the hyperparameters obtain a small loss when applied for training of a new task sampled from the task environment.;arxiv
6766;The difference between the resulting average loss, known as meta-population loss, and the corresponding empirical loss measured on the available data from related tasks, known as meta-generalization gap, is a measure of the generalization capability of the meta-learner.;arxiv
6767;In this paper, we present novel information-theoretic bounds on the average absolute value of the meta-generalization gap.;arxiv
6768;Task similarity is gauged via the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences.;arxiv
6769;We illustrate the proposed bounds on the example of ridge regression with meta-learned bias.;arxiv
6770;Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is of great importance to the many video surveillance systems.;arxiv
6771;Learning discriminative features for Re-ID remains a challenge due to the large variations in the image space, e.g., continuously changing human poses, illuminations and point of views.;arxiv
6772;In this paper, we propose HAVANA, a novel extensible, light-weight HierArchical and VAriation-Normalized Autoencoder that learns features robust to intra-class variations.;arxiv
6773;In contrast to existing generative approaches that prune the variations with heavy extra supervised signals, HAVANA suppresses the intra-class variations with a Variation-Normalized Autoencoder trained with no additional supervision.;arxiv
6774;We also introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon triplet loss for contrastive distribution learning in Re-ID.;arxiv
6775;In addition, we present Hierarchical Variation Distiller, a hierarchical VAE to factorize the latent representation and explicitly model the variations.;arxiv
6776;To the best of our knowledge, HAVANA is the first VAE-based framework for person ReID.;arxiv
6777;The efficiency of deep machine learning for automatic delineation of tumor areas has been demonstrated for intraoperative neuronavigation using active IR-mapping with the use of the cold test.;arxiv
6778;The proposed approach employs a matrix IR-imager to remotely register the space-time distribution of surface temperature pattern, which is determined by the dynamics of local cerebral blood flow.;arxiv
6779;The advantages of this technique are non-invasiveness, zero risks for the health of patients and medical staff, low implementation and operational costs, ease and speed of use.;arxiv
6780;Traditional IR-diagnostic technique has a crucial limitation - it involves a diagnostician who determines the boundaries of tumor areas, which gives rise to considerable uncertainty, which can lead to diagnosis errors that are difficult to control.;arxiv
6781;The current study demonstrates that implementing deep learning algorithms allows to eliminate the explained drawback.;arxiv
6782;Transfer learning is a promising approach to creating predictive models that incorporate simulation and experimental data into a common framework.;arxiv
6783;In this technique, a neural network is first trained on a large database of simulations, then partially retrained on sparse sets of experimental data to adjust predictions to be more consistent with reality.;arxiv
6784;Previously, this technique has been used to create predictive models of Omega and NIF inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments that are more accurate than simulations alone.;arxiv
6785;In this work, we conduct a transfer learning driven hypothetical ICF campaign in which the goal is to maximize experimental neutron yield via Bayesian optimization.;arxiv
6786;The transfer learning model achieves yields within 5% of the maximum achievable yield in a modest-sized design space in fewer than 20 experiments.;arxiv
6787;Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method is more efficient at optimizing designs than traditional model calibration techniques commonly employed in ICF design.;arxiv
6788;Such an approach to ICF design could enable robust optimization of experimental performance under uncertainty.;arxiv
6789;Deep learning (DL) is the state-of-the-art methodology in various medical image segmentation tasks.;arxiv
6790;However, it requires relatively large amounts of manually labeled training data, which may be infeasible to generate in some applications.;arxiv
6791;In addition, DL methods have relatively poor generalizability to out-of-sample data.;arxiv
6792;Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS), on the other hand, has promising performance using limited amounts of training data and good generalizability.;arxiv
6793;A hybrid method that integrates the high accuracy of DL and good generalizability of MAS is highly desired and could play an important role in segmentation problems where manually labeled data is hard to generate.;arxiv
6794;Most of the prior work focuses on improving single components of MAS using DL rather than directly optimizing the final segmentation accuracy via an end-to-end pipeline.;arxiv
6795;Only one study explored this idea in binary segmentation of 2D images, but it remains unknown whether it generalizes well to multi-class 3D segmentation problems.;arxiv
6796;In this study, we propose a 3D end-to-end hybrid pipeline, named deep label fusion (DLF), that takes advantage of the strengths of MAS and DL.;arxiv
6797;Experimental results demonstrate that DLF yields significant improvements over conventional label fusion methods and U-Net, a direct DL approach, in the context of segmenting medial temporal lobe subregions using 3T T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI.;arxiv
6798;Further, when applied to an unseen similar dataset acquired in 7T, DLF maintains its superior performance, which demonstrates its good generalizability.;arxiv
6799;The Jacobian matrix (or the gradient for single-output networks) is directly related to many important properties of neural networks, such as the function landscape, stationary points, (local) Lipschitz constants and robustness to adversarial attacks.;arxiv
6800;In this paper, we propose a recursive algorithm, RecurJac, to compute both upper and lower bounds for each element in the Jacobian matrix of a neural network with respect to network's input, and the network can contain a wide range of activation functions.;arxiv
6801;As a byproduct, we can efficiently obtain a (local) Lipschitz constant, which plays a crucial role in neural network robustness verification, as well as the training stability of GANs.;arxiv
6802;Experiments show that (local) Lipschitz constants produced by our method is of better quality than previous approaches, thus providing better robustness verification results.;arxiv
6803;Our algorithm has polynomial time complexity, and its computation time is reasonable even for relatively large networks.;arxiv
6804;Additionally, we use our bounds of Jacobian matrix to characterize the landscape of the neural network, for example, to determine whether there exist stationary points in a local neighborhood.;arxiv
6805;Graph classification is a widely studied problem and has broad applications.;arxiv
6806;In many real-world problems, the number of labeled graphs available for training classification models is limited, which renders these models prone to overfitting.;arxiv
6807;To address this problem, we propose two approaches based on contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) to alleviate overfitting.;arxiv
6808;In the first approach, we use CSSL to pretrain graph encoders on widely-available unlabeled graphs without relying on human-provided labels, then finetune the pretrained encoders on labeled graphs.;arxiv
6809;In the second approach, we develop a regularizer based on CSSL, and solve the supervised classification task and the unsupervised CSSL task simultaneously.;arxiv
6810;To perform CSSL on graphs, given a collection of original graphs, we perform data augmentation to create augmented graphs out of the original graphs.;arxiv
6811;An augmented graph is created by consecutively applying a sequence of graph alteration operations.;arxiv
6812;A contrastive loss is defined to learn graph encoders by judging whether two augmented graphs are from the same original graph.;arxiv
6813;Experiments on various graph classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.;arxiv
6814;Knowledge tracing (KT) models, e.g., the deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model, track an individual learner's acquisition of skills over time by examining the learner's performance on questions related to those skills.;arxiv
6815;A practical limitation in most existing KT models is that all questions nested under a particular skill are treated as equivalent observations of a learner's ability, which is an inaccurate assumption in real-world educational scenarios.;arxiv
6816;To overcome this limitation we introduce qDKT, a variant of DKT that models every learner's success probability on individual questions over time.;arxiv
6817;First, qDKT incorporates graph Laplacian regularization to smooth predictions under each skill, which is particularly useful when the number of questions in the dataset is big.;arxiv
6818;Second, qDKT uses an initialization scheme inspired by the fastText algorithm, which has found success in a variety of language modeling tasks.;arxiv
6819;Our experiments on several real-world datasets show that qDKT achieves state-of-art performance on predicting learner outcomes.;arxiv
6820;Because of this, qDKT can serve as a simple, yet tough-to-beat, baseline for new question-centric KT models.;arxiv
6821;Mobile and embedded applications require neural networks-based pattern recognition systems to perform well under a tight computational budget.;arxiv
6822;In contrast to commonly used synchronous, frame-based vision systems and CNNs, asynchronous, spiking neural networks driven by event-based visual input respond with low latency to sparse, salient features in the input, leading to high efficiency at run-time.;arxiv
6823;The discrete nature of the event-based data streams makes direct training of asynchronous neural networks challenging.;arxiv
6824;This paper studies asynchronous spiking neural networks, obtained by conversion from a conventional CNN trained on frame-based data.;arxiv
6825;As an example, we consider a CNN trained to steer a robot to follow a moving target.;arxiv
6826;We identify possible pitfalls of the conversion and demonstrate how the proposed solutions bring the classification accuracy of the asynchronous network to only 3\% below the performance of the original synchronous CNN, while requiring 12x fewer computations.;arxiv
6827;While being applied to a simple task, this work is an important step towards low-power, fast, and embedded neural networks-based vision solutions for robotic applications.;arxiv
6828;In this paper, we systematically investigate the above assumption in several NLP tasks.;arxiv
6829;We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that some popular designs of the sample-level loss $G$ may be inconsistent with the true population-level metric $F$ of the task, so that models trained to optimize the former can be substantially sub-optimal to the latter, a phenomenon we call it, Simpson's bias, due to its deep connections with the classic paradox known as Simpson's reversal paradox in statistics and social sciences.;arxiv
6830;Protein engineering seeks to identify protein sequences with optimized properties.;arxiv
6831;When guided by machine learning, protein sequence generation methods can draw on prior knowledge and experimental efforts to improve this process.;arxiv
6832;In this review, we highlight recent applications of machine learning to generate protein sequences, focusing on the emerging field of deep generative methods.;arxiv
6833;A new message-passing (MP) method is considered for the matrix completion problem associated with recommender systems.;arxiv
6834;We attack the problem using a (generative) factor graph model that is related to a probabilistic low-rank matrix factorization.;arxiv
6835;Based on the model, we propose a new algorithm, termed IMP, for the recovery of a data matrix from incomplete observations.;arxiv
6836;The algorithm is based on a clustering followed by inference via MP (IMP).;arxiv
6837;The algorithm is compared with a number of other matrix completion algorithms on real collaborative filtering (e.g., Netflix) data matrices.;arxiv
6838;Our results show that, while many methods perform similarly with a large number of revealed entries, the IMP algorithm outperforms all others when the fraction of observed entries is small.;arxiv
6839;This is helpful because it reduces the well-known cold-start problem associated with collaborative filtering (CF) systems in practice.;arxiv
6840;In this paper, we consider the problem of large scale multi agent reinforcement learning.;arxiv
6841;Firstly, we studied the representation problem of the pairwise value function to reduce the complexity of the interactions among agents.;arxiv
6842;Secondly, we adopt a l2-norm trick to ensure the trivial term of the approximated value function is bounded.;arxiv
6843;Thirdly, experimental results on battle game demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.;arxiv
6844;Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising performance for medical image analysis, while in most cases ground-truth annotations from human experts are necessary to train the deep model.;arxiv
6845;In practice, such annotations are expensive to collect and can be scarce for medical imaging applications.;arxiv
6846;Therefore, there is significant interest in learning representations from unlabelled raw data.;arxiv
6847;In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning approach to learn meaningful and transferable representations from medical imaging video without any type of human annotation.;arxiv
6848;We assume that in order to learn such a representation, the model should identify anatomical structures from the unlabelled data.;arxiv
6849;Therefore we force the model to address anatomy-aware tasks with free supervision from the data itself.;arxiv
6850;Specifically, the model is designed to correct the order of a reshuffled video clip and at the same time predict the geometric transformation applied to the video clip.;arxiv
6851;Experiments on fetal ultrasound video show that the proposed approach can effectively learn meaningful and strong representations, which transfer well to downstream tasks like standard plane detection and saliency prediction.;arxiv
6852;The automatic digitizing of paper maps is a significant and challenging task for both academia and industry.;arxiv
6853;As an important procedure of map digitizing, the semantic segmentation section mainly relies on manual visual interpretation with low efficiency.;arxiv
6854;In this study, we select urban planning maps as a representative sample and investigate the feasibility of utilizing U-shape fully convolutional based architecture to perform end-to-end map semantic segmentation.;arxiv
6855;The experimental results obtained from the test area in Shibuya district, Tokyo, demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve a very high Jaccard similarity coefficient of 93.63% and an overall accuracy of 99.36%.;arxiv
6856;For implementation on GPGPU and cuDNN, the required processing time for the whole Shibuya district can be less than three minutes.;arxiv
6857;The results indicate the proposed method can serve as a viable tool for urban planning map semantic segmentation task with high accuracy and efficiency.;arxiv
6858;This paper mainly discusses the generation of personalized fonts as the problem of image style transfer.;arxiv
6859;The main purpose of this paper is to design a network framework that can extract and recombine the content and style of the characters.;arxiv
6860;These attempts can be used to synthesize the entire set of fonts with only a small amount of characters.;arxiv
6861;The paper combines various depth networks such as Convolutional Neural Network, Multi-layer Perceptron and Residual Network to find the optimal model to extract the features of the fonts character.;arxiv
6862;The result shows that those characters we have generated is very close to real characters, using Structural Similarity index and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio evaluation criterions.;arxiv
6863;Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a widely deployed method to sample from high-dimensional distributions in Statistics and Machine learning.;arxiv
6864;"HMC is known to run very efficiently in practice and its popular second-order ""leapfrog"" implementation has long been conjectured to run in $d^{1/4}$ gradient evaluations.";arxiv
6865;Here we show that this conjecture is true when sampling from strongly log-concave target distributions that satisfy a weak third-order regularity property associated with the input data.;arxiv
6866;Our regularity condition is weaker than the Lipschitz Hessian property and allows us to show faster convergence bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual Lipschitz Hessian constant alone.;arxiv
6867;"Important distributions that satisfy our regularity condition include posterior distributions used in Bayesian logistic regression for which the data satisfies an ""incoherence"" property.";arxiv
6868;Our result compares favorably with the best available bounds for the class of strongly log-concave distributions, which grow like $d^{{1}/{2}}$ gradient evaluations with the dimension.;arxiv
6869;Moreover, our simulations on synthetic data suggest that, when our regularity condition is satisfied, leapfrog HMC performs better than its competitors -- both in terms of accuracy and in terms of the number of gradient evaluations it requires.;arxiv
6870;Recent attempts at Super-Resolution for medical images used deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve perceptually realistic single image Super-Resolution.;arxiv
6871;Yet, they are constrained by their inability to generalise to different scale factors.;arxiv
6872;This involves high storage and energy costs as every integer scale factor involves a separate neural network.;arxiv
6873;A recent paper has proposed a novel meta-learning technique that uses a Weight Prediction Network to enable Super-Resolution on arbitrary scale factors using only a single neural network.;arxiv
6874;In this paper, we propose a new network that combines that technique with SRGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN-based architecture, to achieve arbitrary scale, high fidelity Super-Resolution for medical images.;arxiv
6875;By using this network to perform arbitrary scale magnifications on images from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset, we demonstrate that it is able to outperform traditional interpolation methods by up to 20$\%$ on SSIM scores whilst retaining generalisability on brain MRI images.;arxiv
6876;We show that performance across scales is not compromised, and that it is able to achieve competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods such as EDSR whilst being fifty times smaller than them.;arxiv
6877;Combining efficiency, performance, and generalisability, this can hopefully become a new foundation for tackling Super-Resolution on medical images.;arxiv

6885;Normalization methods are a central building block in the deep learning toolbox.;arxiv
6886;They accelerate and stabilize training, while decreasing the dependence on manually tuned learning rate schedules.;arxiv
6887;When learning from multi-modal distributions, the effectiveness of batch normalization (BN), arguably the most prominent normalization method, is reduced.;arxiv
6888;As a remedy, we propose a more flexible approach: by extending the normalization to more than a single mean and variance, we detect modes of data on-the-fly, jointly normalizing samples that share common features.;arxiv
6889;We demonstrate that our method outperforms BN and other widely used normalization techniques in several experiments, including single and multi-task datasets.;arxiv
6890;Variable screening is a fast dimension reduction technique for assisting high dimensional feature selection.;arxiv
6891;As a preselection method, it selects a moderate size subset of candidate variables for further refining via feature selection to produce the final model.;arxiv
6892;The performance of variable screening depends on both computational efficiency and the ability to dramatically reduce the number of variables without discarding the important ones.;arxiv
6893;This article studies a class of linear screening methods and establishes consistency theory for this special class.;arxiv
6894;In particular, we prove the restricted diagonally dominant (RDD) condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for strong screening consistency.;arxiv

6901;Approximate inference in complex probabilistic models such as deep Gaussian processes requires the optimisation of doubly stochastic objective functions.;arxiv
6902;These objectives incorporate randomness both from mini-batch subsampling of the data and from Monte Carlo estimation of expectations.;arxiv
6903;If the gradient variance is high, the stochastic optimisation problem becomes difficult with a slow rate of convergence.;arxiv
6904;Control variates can be used to reduce the variance, but past approaches do not take into account how mini-batch stochasticity affects sampling stochasticity, resulting in sub-optimal variance reduction.;arxiv
6905;We propose a new approach in which we use a recognition network to cheaply approximate the optimal control variate for each mini-batch, with no additional model gradient computations.;arxiv

6908;Materials and Methods: Using two datasets from different institutions with a total of 36,900 MRI slices, we trained a deep learning-based model to work directly with the complex raw k-space data.;arxiv
6909;Skull stripping performed by HD-BET (Brain Extraction Tool) in the image domain were used as the ground truth.;arxiv
6910;Results: Both datasets were very similar to the ground truth (DICE scores of 92\%-98\% and Hausdorff distances of under 5.5 mm).;arxiv
6911;Results on slices above the eye-region reach DICE scores of up to 99\%, while the accuracy drops in regions around the eyes and below, with partially blurred output.;arxiv

6916;Traditional recommendation systems are faced with two long-standing obstacles, namely, data sparsity and cold-start problems, which promote the emergence and development of Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR).;arxiv
6917;The core idea of CDR is to leverage information collected from other domains to alleviate the two problems in one domain.;arxiv
6918;Over the last decade, many efforts have been engaged for cross-domain recommendation.;arxiv
6919;Recently, with the development of deep learning and neural networks, a large number of methods have emerged.;arxiv
6920;However, there is a limited number of systematic surveys on CDR, especially regarding the latest proposed methods as well as the recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks they address.;arxiv
6921;In this survey paper, we first proposed a two-level taxonomy of cross-domain recommendation which classifies different recommendation scenarios and recommendation tasks.;arxiv
6922;We then introduce and summarize existing cross-domain recommendation approaches under different recommendation scenarios in a structured manner.;arxiv
6923;We conclude this survey by providing several potential research directions about this field.;arxiv
6924;While rule-based attribution methods have proven useful for providing local explanations for Deep Neural Networks, explaining modern and more varied network architectures yields new challenges in generating trustworthy explanations, since the established rule sets might not be sufficient or applicable to novel network structures.;arxiv
6925;As an elegant solution to the above issue, network canonization has recently been introduced.;arxiv
6926;This procedure leverages the implementation-dependency of rule-based attributions and restructures a model into a functionally identical equivalent of alternative design to which established attribution rules can be applied.;arxiv
6927;However, the idea of canonization and its usefulness have so far only been explored qualitatively.;arxiv
6928;In this work, we quantitatively verify the beneficial effects of network canonization to rule-based attributions on VGG-16 and ResNet18 models with BatchNorm layers and thus extend the current best practices for obtaining reliable neural network explanations.;arxiv
6929;While adversarial training and its variants have shown to be the most effective algorithms to defend against adversarial attacks, their extremely slow training process makes it hard to scale to large datasets like ImageNet.;arxiv
6930;The key idea of recent works to accelerate adversarial training is to substitute multi-step attacks (e.g., PGD) with single-step attacks (e.g., FGSM).;arxiv
6931;However, these single-step methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting, where the accuracy against PGD attack suddenly drops to nearly 0% during training, destroying the robustness of the networks.;arxiv
6932;In this work, we study the phenomenon from the perspective of training instances.;arxiv
6933;We show that catastrophic overfitting is instance-dependent and fitting instances with larger gradient norm is more likely to cause catastrophic overfitting.;arxiv
6934;Based on our findings, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Training with Adaptive Step size (ATAS).;arxiv
6935;ATAS learns an instancewise adaptive step size that is inversely proportional to its gradient norm.;arxiv
6936;The theoretical analysis shows that ATAS converges faster than the commonly adopted non-adaptive counterparts.;arxiv
6937;Empirically, ATAS consistently mitigates catastrophic overfitting and achieves higher robust accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet when evaluated on various adversarial budgets.;arxiv
6938;Importance-weighting is a popular and well-researched technique for dealing with sample selection bias and covariate shift.;arxiv
6939;It has desirable characteristics such as unbiasedness, consistency and low computational complexity.;arxiv
6940;However, weighting can have a detrimental effect on an estimator as well.;arxiv
6941;In this work, we empirically show that the sampling distribution of an importance-weighted estimator can be skewed.;arxiv
6942;These over- and underestimates of the risk lead to suboptimal regularization parameters when used for importance-weighted validation.;arxiv
6943;Constructing reliable prediction sets is an obstacle for applications of neural models: Distribution-free conditional coverage is theoretically impossible, and the exchangeability assumption underpinning the coverage guarantees of standard split-conformal approaches is violated on domain shifts.;arxiv
6944;Given these challenges, we propose and analyze a data-driven procedure for obtaining empirically reliable approximate conditional coverage, calculating unique quantile thresholds for each label for each test point.;arxiv
6945;We achieve this via the strong signals for prediction reliability from KNN-based model approximations over the training set and approximations over constrained samples from the held-out calibration set.;arxiv
6946;Cross-validation (CV) is a technique used to estimate generalization error for prediction models.;arxiv
6947;While theoretically sound, following this recommendation can lead to high computational costs when a pipeline modeling algorithm includes computationally expensive operations, e.g. imputation of missing values.;arxiv
6948;We empirically assessed whether conducting unsupervised imputation prior to CV would result in biased estimates of generalization error or result in poorly selected tuning parameters and thus degrade the external performance of downstream models.;arxiv
6949;Results show that despite optimistic bias, the reduced variance of imputation before CV compared to imputation during each replicate of CV leads to a lower overall root mean squared error for estimation of the true external R-squared and the performance of models tuned using CV with imputation before versus during each replication is minimally different.;arxiv
6950;In conclusion, unsupervised imputation before CV appears valid in certain settings and may be a helpful strategy that enables analysts to use more flexible imputation techniques without incurring high computational costs.;arxiv
6951;In (Franceschi et al., 2018) we proposed a unified mathematical framework, grounded on bilevel programming, that encompasses gradient-based hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning.;arxiv
6952;We formulated an approximate version of the problem where the inner objective is solved iteratively, and gave sufficient conditions ensuring convergence to the exact problem.;arxiv
6953;In this work we show how to optimize learning rates, automatically weight the loss of single examples and learn hyper-representations with Far-HO, a software package based on the popular deep learning framework TensorFlow that allows to seamlessly tackle both HO and ML problems.;arxiv
6954;Images acquired from rainy scenes usually suffer from bad visibility which may damage the performance of computer vision applications.;arxiv
6955;The rainy scenarios can be categorized into two classes: moderate rain and heavy rain scenes.;arxiv
6956;Moderate rain scene mainly consists of rain streaks while heavy rain scene contains both rain streaks and the veiling effect (similar to haze).;arxiv
6957;Although existing methods have achieved excellent performance on these two cases individually, it still lacks a general architecture to address both heavy rain and moderate rain scenarios effectively.;arxiv
6958;In this paper, we construct a hierarchical multi-direction representation network by using the contourlet transform (CT) to address both moderate rain and heavy rain scenarios.;arxiv
6959;The CT divides the image into the multi-direction subbands (MS) and the semantic subband (SS).;arxiv
6960;First, the rain streak information is retrieved to the MS based on the multi-orientation property of the CT.;arxiv
6961;Second, a hierarchical architecture is proposed to reconstruct the background information including damaged semantic information and the veiling effect in the SS.;arxiv
6962;Last, the multi-level subband discriminator with the feedback error map is proposed.;arxiv
6963;By this module, all subbands can be well optimized.;arxiv
6964;This is the first architecture that can address both of the two scenarios effectively.;arxiv
6965;Event detection is a critical task for timely decision-making in graph analytics applications.;arxiv
6966;Despite the recent progress towards deep learning on graphs, event detection on dynamic graphs presents particular challenges to existing architectures.;arxiv
6967;Real-life events are often associated with sudden deviations of the normal behavior of the graph.;arxiv
6968;However, existing approaches for dynamic node embedding are unable to capture the graph-level dynamics related to events.;arxiv
6969;In this paper, we propose DyGED, a simple yet novel deep learning model for event detection on dynamic graphs.;arxiv
6970;Moreover, our approach combines structural and temporal self-attention mechanisms to account for application-specific node and time importances effectively.;arxiv
6971;Our experimental evaluation, using a representative set of datasets, demonstrates that DyGED outperforms competing solutions in terms of event detection accuracy by up to 8.5% while being more scalable than the top alternatives.;arxiv
6972;We also present case studies illustrating key features of our model.;arxiv
6973;For lossy image compression, we develop a neural-based system which learns a nonlinear estimator for decoding from quantized representations.;arxiv
6974;"The system links two recurrent networks that \help"" each other reconstruct same target image patches using complementary portions of spatial context that communicate via gradient signals.";arxiv
6975;This dual agent system builds upon prior work that proposed the iterative refinement algorithm for recurrent neural network (RNN)based decoding which improved image reconstruction compared to standard decoding techniques.;arxiv
6976;Our approach, which works with any encoder, neural or non-neural, This system progressively reduces image patch reconstruction error over a fixed number of steps.;arxiv
6977;Experiment with variants of RNN memory cells, with and without future information, find that our model consistently creates lower distortion images of higher perceptual quality compared to other approaches.;arxiv
6978;Specifically, on the Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite, we observe as much as a 1:64 decibel (dB) gain over JPEG, a 1:46 dB gain over JPEG 2000, a 1:34 dB gain over the GOOG neural baseline, 0:36 over E2E (a modern competitive neural compression model), and 0:37 over a single iterative neural decoder.;arxiv
6979;With the effective application of deep learning in computer vision, breakthroughs have been made in the research of super-resolution images reconstruction.;arxiv
6980;However, many researches have pointed out that the insufficiency of the neural network extraction on image features may bring the deteriorating of newly reconstructed image.;arxiv
6981;On the other hand, the generated pictures are sometimes too artificial because of over-smoothing.;arxiv
6982;In order to solve the above problems, we propose a novel self-calibrated convolutional generative adversarial networks.;arxiv
6983;The generator consists of feature extraction and image reconstruction.;arxiv
6984;Feature extraction uses self-calibrated convolutions, which contains four portions, and each portion has specific functions.;arxiv
6985;It can not only expand the range of receptive fields, but also obtain long-range spatial and inter-channel dependencies.;arxiv
6986;Then image reconstruction is performed, and finally a super-resolution image is reconstructed.;arxiv
6987;We have conducted thorough experiments on different datasets including set5, set14 and BSD100 under the SSIM evaluation method.;arxiv
6988;The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed network.;arxiv
6989;Adversarial attacks have been expanded to speaker recognition (SR).;arxiv
6990;However, existing attacks are often assessed using different SR models, recognition tasks and datasets, and only few adversarial defenses borrowed from computer vision are considered.;arxiv
6991;Yet,these defenses have not been thoroughly evaluated against adaptive attacks.;arxiv
6992;Thus, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding about the strengths and limitations of adversarial attacks and defenses.;arxiv
6993;More effective defenses are also required for securing SR systems.;arxiv
6994;To bridge this gap, we present SEC4SR, the first platform enabling researchers to systematically and comprehensively evaluate adversarial attacks and defenses in SR.;arxiv
6995;SEC4SR incorporates 4 white-box and 2 black-box attacks, 24 defenses including our novel feature-level transformations.;arxiv
6996;It also contains techniques for mounting adaptive attacks.;arxiv
6997;Using SEC4SR, we conduct thus far the largest-scale empirical study on adversarial attacks and defenses in SR, involving 23 defenses, 15 attacks and 4 attack settings.;arxiv
6998;Extensive experiments demonstrate capabilities and advantages of SEC4SR which can benefit future research in SR.;arxiv
6999;Natural gradient descent, which preconditions a gradient descent update with the Fisher information matrix of the underlying statistical model, is a way to capture partial second-order information.;arxiv
7000;Several highly visible works have advocated an approximation known as the empirical Fisher, drawing connections between approximate second-order methods and heuristics like Adam.;arxiv
7001;We dispute this argument by showing that the empirical Fisher---unlike the Fisher---does not generally capture second-order information.;arxiv
7002;We further argue that the conditions under which the empirical Fisher approaches the Fisher (and the Hessian) are unlikely to be met in practice, and that, even on simple optimization problems, the pathologies of the empirical Fisher can have undesirable effects.;arxiv
7003;The redundancy is widely recognized in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which enables to remove unimportant filters from convolutional layers so as to slim the network with acceptable performance drop.;arxiv
7004;Inspired by the linear and combinational properties of convolution, we seek to make some filters increasingly close and eventually identical for network slimming.;arxiv
7005;To this end, we propose Centripetal SGD (C-SGD), a novel optimization method, which can train several filters to collapse into a single point in the parameter hyperspace.;arxiv
7006;When the training is completed, the removal of the identical filters can trim the network with NO performance loss, thus no finetuning is needed.;arxiv
7007;By doing so, we have partly solved an open problem of constrained filter pruning on CNNs with complicated structure, where some layers must be pruned following others.;arxiv
7008;Our experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified the effectiveness of C-SGD-based filter pruning.;arxiv
7009;Moreover, we have provided empirical evidences for the assumption that the redundancy in deep neural networks helps the convergence of training by showing that a redundant CNN trained using C-SGD outperforms a normally trained counterpart with the equivalent width.;arxiv
7010;We explore a new perspective on adapting the learning rate (LR) schedule to improve the performance of the ReLU-based network as it is iteratively pruned.;arxiv
7011;Our work and contribution consist of four parts: (i);arxiv
7012;We find that, as the ReLU-based network is iteratively pruned, the distribution of weight gradients tends to become narrower.;arxiv
7013;This leads to the finding that as the network becomes more sparse, a larger value of LR should be used to train the pruned network.;arxiv
7014;(ii) Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel LR schedule, called S-Cyclical (S-Cyc) which adapts the conventional cyclical LR schedule by gradually increasing the LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape as the network is iteratively pruned.;arxiv
7015;We highlight that S-Cyc is a method agnostic LR schedule that applies to many iterative pruning methods.;arxiv
7016;(iii) We evaluate the performance of the proposed S-Cyc and compare it to four LR schedule benchmarks.;arxiv
7017;Our experimental results on three state-of-the-art networks (e.g., VGG-19, ResNet-20, ResNet-50) and two popular datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet-200) demonstrate that S-Cyc consistently outperforms the best performing benchmark with an improvement of 2.1% - 3.4%, without substantial increase in complexity.;arxiv
7018;Backdoor attacks impose a new threat in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where a backdoor is inserted into the neural network by poisoning the training dataset, misclassifying inputs that contain the adversary trigger.;arxiv
7019;The major challenge for defending against these attacks is that only the attacker knows the secret trigger and the target class.;arxiv
7020;"The problem is further exacerbated by the recent introduction of ""Hidden Triggers"", where the triggers are carefully fused into the input, bypassing detection by human inspection and causing backdoor identification through anomaly detection to fail.";arxiv
7021;We propose PiDAn, an algorithm based on coherence optimization purifying the poisoned data.;arxiv
7022;Our analysis shows that representations of poisoned data and authentic data in the target class are still embedded in different linear subspaces, which implies that they show different coherence with some latent spaces.;arxiv
7023;"Based on this observation, the proposed PiDAn algorithm learns a sample-wise weight vector to maximize the projected coherence of weighted samples, where we demonstrate that the learned weight vector has a natural ""grouping effect"" and is distinguishable between authentic data and poisoned data.";arxiv
7024;This enables the systematic detection and mitigation of backdoor attacks.;arxiv
7025;Based on our theoretical analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PiDAn in defending against backdoor attacks that use different settings of poisoned samples on GTSRB and ILSVRC2012 datasets.;arxiv
7026;Our PiDAn algorithm can detect more than 90% infected classes and identify 95% poisoned samples.;arxiv
7027;Machine learning pipelines often rely on optimization procedures to make discrete decisions (e.g., sorting, picking closest neighbors, or shortest paths).;arxiv
7028;Although these discrete decisions are easily computed, they break the back-propagation of computational graphs.;arxiv
7029;In order to expand the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a systematic method to transform optimizers into operations that are differentiable and never locally constant.;arxiv
7030;Our approach relies on stochastically perturbed optimizers, and can be used readily together with existing solvers.;arxiv
7031;Their derivatives can be evaluated efficiently, and smoothness tuned via the chosen noise amplitude.;arxiv
7032;We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and give theoretical guarantees for their use in learning tasks.;arxiv
7033;We demonstrate experimentally the performance of our approach on various tasks.;arxiv
7034;Layer-sequential unit-variance (LSUV) initialization - a simple method for weight initialization for deep net learning - is proposed.;arxiv
7035;First, pre-initialize weights of each convolution or inner-product layer with orthonormal matrices.;arxiv
7036;Second, proceed from the first to the final layer, normalizing the variance of the output of each layer to be equal to one.;arxiv
7037;Experiment with different activation functions (maxout, ReLU-family, tanh) show that the proposed initialization leads to learning of very deep nets that (i) produces networks with test accuracy better or equal to standard methods and (ii) is at least as fast as the complex schemes proposed specifically for very deep nets such as FitNets (Romero et al. (2015)) and Highway (Srivastava et al. (2015)).;arxiv
7038;Performance is evaluated on GoogLeNet, CaffeNet, FitNets and Residual nets and the state-of-the-art, or very close to it, is achieved on the MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets.;arxiv
7039;Computational auditory scene analysis is gaining interest in the last years.;arxiv
7040;Trailing behind the more mature field of speech recognition, it is particularly general sound event detection that is attracting increasing attention.;arxiv
7041;Crucial for training and testing reasonable models is having available enough suitable data -- until recently, general sound event databases were hardly found.;arxiv
7042;All sound events are strongly labeled with perceptual on- and offset times, paying attention to omitting in-between silences.;arxiv
7043;The amount of isolated sound events, the quality of annotations, and the particular general sound class distinguish NIGENS from other databases.;arxiv
7044;Big Data concern large-volume, growing data sets that are complex and have multiple autonomous sources.;arxiv
7045;Earlier technologies were not able to handle storage and processing of huge data thus Big Data concept comes into existence.;arxiv
7046;This is a tedious job for users unstructured data.;arxiv
7047;So, there should be some mechanism which classify unstructured data into organized form which helps user to easily access required data.;arxiv
7048;Classification techniques over big transactional database provide required data to the users from large datasets more simple way.;arxiv
7049;There are two main classification techniques, supervised and unsupervised.;arxiv
7050;In this paper we focused on to study of different supervised classification techniques.;arxiv
7051;Further this paper shows a advantages and limitations.;arxiv
7052;Neural networks represent data as projections on trained weights in a high dimensional manifold.;arxiv
7053;The trained weights act as a knowledge base consisting of causal class dependencies.;arxiv
7054;Inference built on features that identify these dependencies is termed as feed-forward inference.;arxiv
7055;Such inference mechanisms are justified based on classical cause-to-effect inductive reasoning models.;arxiv
7056;Inductive reasoning based feed-forward inference is widely used due to its mathematical simplicity and operational ease.;arxiv
7057;Nevertheless, feed-forward models do not generalize well to untrained situations.;arxiv
7058;To alleviate this generalization challenge, we propose using an effect-to-cause inference model that reasons abductively.;arxiv
7059;Here, the features represent the change from existing weight dependencies given a certain effect.;arxiv
7060;We term this change as contrast and the ensuing reasoning mechanism as contrastive reasoning.;arxiv
7061;In this paper, we formalize the structure of contrastive reasoning and propose a methodology to extract a neural network's notion of contrast.;arxiv
7062;We demonstrate the value of contrastive reasoning in two stages of a neural network's reasoning pipeline : in inferring and visually explaining decisions for the application of object recognition.;arxiv
7063;We illustrate the value of contrastively recognizing images under distortions by reporting an improvement of 3.47%, 2.56%, and 5.48% in average accuracy under the proposed contrastive framework on CIFAR-10C, noisy STL-10, and VisDA datasets respectively.;arxiv
7064;Difficult image segmentation problems, for instance left atrium MRI, can be addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent with known objects.;arxiv
7065;Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the prior distribution is multimodal.;arxiv
7066;Nonparametric density estimation is more general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces.;arxiv
7067;Here, we propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors.;arxiv
7068;We use deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding the careful selection of hand-crafted features.;arxiv
7069;We formulate the shape prior as a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional subspace.;arxiv
7070;In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized expectation-maximization framework.;arxiv
7071;We present a conditional maximization-based scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties.;arxiv
7072;We demonstrate our approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.;arxiv
7073;The Social Internet of Things (SIoT), integration of the Internet of Things and Social Networks paradigms, has been introduced to build a network of smart nodes that are capable of establishing social links.;arxiv
7074;In order to deal with misbehaving service provider nodes, service requestor nodes must evaluate their trustworthiness levels.;arxiv
7075;In this paper, we propose a novel trust management mechanism in the SIoT to predict the most reliable service providers for each service requestor, which leads to reduce the risk of being exposed to malicious nodes.;arxiv
7076;We model the SIoT with a flexible bipartite graph (containing two sets of nodes: service providers and service requestors), then build a social network among the service requestor nodes, using the Hellinger distance.;arxiv
7077;Afterward, we develop a social trust model using nodes' centrality and similarity measures to extract trust behaviors among the social network nodes.;arxiv
7078;Finally, a matrix factorization technique is designed to extract latent features of SIoT nodes, find trustworthy nodes, and mitigate the data sparsity and cold start problems.;arxiv
7079;We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed trust prediction mechanism on prediction accuracy.;arxiv
7080;The results indicate that feedbacks from the neighboring nodes of a specific service requestor with high Hellinger similarity in our mechanism outperforms the best existing methods.;arxiv
7081;We also show that utilizing the social trust model, which only considers a similarity measure, significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction mechanism.;arxiv
7082;Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management system through a real-world SIoT use case.;arxiv
7083;Our results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is resilient to different types of network attacks, and it can accurately find the most proper and trustworthy service provider.;arxiv
7084;In real-world edge AI applications, their accuracy is often affected by various environmental factors, such as noises, location/calibration of sensors, and time-related changes.;arxiv
7085;This article introduces a neural network based on-device learning approach to address this issue without going deep.;arxiv
7086;This article introduces its algorithm and implementation on a wireless sensor node consisting of Raspberry Pi Pico and low-power wireless module.;arxiv
7087;Experiments using vibration patterns of rotating machines demonstrate that retraining by the on-device learning significantly improves an anomaly detection accuracy at a noisy environment while saving computation and communication costs for low power.;arxiv
7088;Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task.;arxiv
7089;Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies.;arxiv
7090;However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient.;arxiv
7091;In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem.;arxiv
7092;We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.;arxiv
7093;Typically, a data owner (API provider) develops a model, often over proprietary data, and leverages the infrastructure services of a cloud vendor for hosting and serving API requests.;arxiv
7094;Clearly, this model assumes complete trust between the API Provider and cloud vendor.;arxiv
7095;On the other hand, a malicious/buggy cloud vendor may copy the APIs and offer an identical service, under-report model usage metrics, or unfairly discriminate between different API providers by offering them a nominal share of the revenue.;arxiv
7096;In this work, we present the design of a blockchain based decentralized trustless API marketplace that enables all the stakeholders in the API ecosystem to audit the behavior of the parties without having to trust a single centralized entity.;arxiv
7097;In particular, our system divides an AI model into multiple pieces and deploys them among multiple cloud vendors who then collaboratively execute the APIs.;arxiv
7098;Our design ensures that cloud vendors cannot collude with each other to steal the combined model, while individual cloud vendors and clients cannot repudiate their input or model executions.;arxiv
7099;We show that model compression can improve the population risk of a pre-trained model, by studying the tradeoff between the decrease in the generalization error and the increase in the empirical risk with model compression.;arxiv
7100;We then characterize the increase in empirical risk with model compression using rate distortion theory.;arxiv
7101;These results imply that the population risk could be improved by model compression if the decrease in generalization error exceeds the increase in empirical risk.;arxiv
7102;We show through a linear regression example that such a decrease in population risk due to model compression is indeed possible.;arxiv
7103;Our theoretical results further suggest that the Hessian-weighted $K$-means clustering compression approach can be improved by regularizing the distance between the clustering centers.;arxiv
7104;We provide experiments with neural networks to support our theoretical assertions.;arxiv
7105;In the visual decoding domain, visually reconstructing presented images given the corresponding human brain activity monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is difficult, especially when reconstructing viewed natural images.;arxiv
7106;Visual reconstruction is a conditional image generation on fMRI data and thus generative adversarial network (GAN) for natural image generation is recently introduced for this task.;arxiv
7107;Although GAN-based methods have greatly improved, the fidelity and naturalness of reconstruction are still unsatisfactory due to the small number of fMRI data samples and the instability of GAN training.;arxiv
7108;In this study, we proposed a new GAN-based Bayesian visual reconstruction method (GAN-BVRM) that includes a classifier to decode categories from fMRI data, a pre-trained conditional generator to generate natural images of specified categories, and a set of encoding models and evaluator to evaluate generated images.;arxiv
7109;GAN-BVRM employs the pre-trained generator of the prevailing BigGAN to generate masses of natural images, and selects the images that best matches with the corresponding brain activity through the encoding models as the reconstruction of the image stimuli.;arxiv
7110;In this process, the semantic and detailed contents of reconstruction are controlled by decoded categories and encoding models, respectively.;arxiv
7111;GAN-BVRM used the Bayesian manner to avoid contradiction between naturalness and fidelity from current GAN-based methods and thus can improve the advantages of GAN.;arxiv
7112;Experimental results revealed that GAN-BVRM improves the fidelity and naturalness, that is, the reconstruction is natural and similar to the presented image stimuli.;arxiv
7113;This paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously identifies demand baselines and the incentive-based agent demand response model, from the net demand measurements and incentive signals.;arxiv
7114;These two intermediate predictions are integrated, to form the net demand forecast.;arxiv
7115;We then propose a gradient-descent approach that backpropagates the net demand forecast errors to update the weights of the agent model and the weights of baseline demand forecast, jointly.;arxiv
7116;We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through computation experiments with synthetic demand response traces and a large-scale real world demand response dataset.;arxiv
7117;Our results show that the approach accurately identifies the demand response model, even without any prior knowledge about the baseline demand.;arxiv
7118;Accurate hardware performance models are critical to efficient code generation.;arxiv
7119;They can be used by compilers to make heuristic decisions, by superoptimizers as a minimization objective, or by autotuners to find an optimal configuration for a specific program.;arxiv
7120;However, they are difficult to develop because contemporary processors are complex, and the recent proliferation of deep learning accelerators has increased the development burden.;arxiv
7121;We demonstrate a method of learning performance models from a corpus of tensor computation graph programs for Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) instances.;arxiv
7122;We show that our learned model outperforms a heavily-optimized analytical performance model on two tasks -- tile-size selection and operator fusion -- and that it helps an autotuner discover faster programs in a setting where access to TPUs is limited or expensive.;arxiv
7123;We design and analyze an algorithm for first-order stochastic optimization of a large class of functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we consider the \emph{variationally coherent} functions which can be convex or non-convex.;arxiv
7124;The iterates of our algorithm on variationally coherent functions converge almost surely to the global minimizer $\boldsymbol{x}^*$. Additionally, the very same algorithm with the same hyperparameters, after $T$ iterations guarantees on convex functions that the expected suboptimality gap is bounded by $\widetilde{O}(\|\boldsymbol{x}^* - \boldsymbol{x}_0\| T^{-1/2+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$.;arxiv
7125;It is the first algorithm to achieve both these properties at the same time.;arxiv
7126;Also, the rate for convex functions essentially matches the performance of parameter-free algorithms.;arxiv
7127;Our algorithm is an instance of the Follow The Regularized Leader algorithm with the added twist of using \emph{rescaled gradients} and time-varying linearithmic regularizers.;arxiv
7128;In this paper, we proposed and validated a fully automatic pipeline for hippocampal surface generation via 3D U-net coupled with active shape modeling (ASM).;arxiv
7129;Principally, the proposed pipeline consisted of three steps.;arxiv
7130;In the beginning, for each magnetic resonance image, a 3D U-net was employed to obtain the automatic hippocampus segmentation at each hemisphere.;arxiv
7131;Secondly, ASM was performed on a group of pre-obtained template surfaces to generate mean shape and shape variation parameters through principal component analysis.;arxiv
7132;Ultimately, hybrid particle swarm optimization was utilized to search for the optimal shape variation parameters that best match the segmentation.;arxiv
7133;The hippocampal surface was then generated from the mean shape and the shape variation parameters.;arxiv
7134;The proposed pipeline was observed to provide hippocampal surfaces at both hemispheres with high accuracy, correct anatomical topology, and sufficient smoothness.;arxiv
7135;Image repurposing is a commonly used method for spreading misinformation on social media and online forums, which involves publishing untampered images with modified metadata to create rumors and further propaganda.;arxiv
7136;While manual verification is possible, given vast amounts of verified knowledge available on the internet, the increasing prevalence and ease of this form of semantic manipulation call for the development of robust automatic ways of assessing the semantic integrity of multimedia data.;arxiv
7137;In this paper, we present a novel method for image repurposing detection that is based on the real-world adversarial interplay between a bad actor who repurposes images with counterfeit metadata and a watchdog who verifies the semantic consistency between images and their accompanying metadata, where both players have access to a reference dataset of verified content, which they can use to achieve their goals.;arxiv
7138;The proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on location-identity, subject-identity and painting-artist verification, showing its efficacy across a diverse set of scenarios.;arxiv
7139;There is increasing interest in learning algorithms that involve interaction between human and machine.;arxiv
7140;Comparison-based queries are among the most natural ways to get feedback from humans.;arxiv
7141;A challenge in designing comparison-based interactive learning algorithms is coping with noisy answers.;arxiv
7142;The most common fix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many situations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of independent noise in different repetitions of the same query.;arxiv
7143;In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about the answer.;arxiv
7144;This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone regions.;arxiv
7145;We also consider the application of this weak oracle model to the problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem) through comparisons.;arxiv
7146;More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric via invocation of the weak comparison oracle.;arxiv
7147;We propose two algorithms termed WORCS-I and WORCS-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison-based Search), which provably locate the target object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution.;arxiv
7148;While WORCS-I provides better theoretical guarantees, WORCS-II is applicable to more technically challenging scenarios where the algorithm has limited access to the ranking dissimilarity between objects.;arxiv

7150;This study addresses the issue of predicting the glaucomatous visual field loss from patient disease datasets.;arxiv
7151;Our goal is to accurately predict the progress of the disease in individual patients.;arxiv
7152;As very few measurements are available for each patient, it is difficult to produce good predictors for individuals.;arxiv
7153;A recently proposed clustering-based method enhances the power of prediction using patient data with similar spatiotemporal patterns.;arxiv
7154;Each patient is categorized into a cluster of patients, and a predictive model is constructed using all of the data in the class.;arxiv
7155;Predictions are highly dependent on the quality of clustering, but it is difficult to identify the best clustering method.;arxiv
7156;Thus, we propose a method for aggregating cluster-based predictors to obtain better prediction accuracy than from a single cluster-based prediction.;arxiv
7157;Further, the method shows very high performances by hierarchically aggregating experts generated from several cluster-based methods.;arxiv
7158;We use real datasets to demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than conventional clustering-based and patient-wise regression methods, because the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a mechanism whereby good predictors in a small community can thrive.;arxiv
7159;Long Short-Term Memory networks trained with gradient descent and back-propagation have received great success in various applications.;arxiv
7160;However, point estimation of the weights of the networks is prone to over-fitting problems and lacks important uncertainty information associated with the estimation.;arxiv
7161;However, exact Bayesian neural network methods are intractable and non-applicable for real-world applications.;arxiv
7162;In this study, we propose an approximate estimation of the weights uncertainty using Ensemble Kalman Filter, which is easily scalable to a large number of weights.;arxiv

7166;Briefness and comprehensiveness are necessary in order to provide a large amount of information concisely when explaining a black-box decision system.;arxiv
7167;However, existing interpretable machine learning methods fail to consider briefness and comprehensiveness simultaneously, leading to redundant explanations.;arxiv
7168;We propose the variational information bottleneck for interpretation, VIBI, a system-agnostic interpretable method that provides a brief but comprehensive explanation.;arxiv
7169;VIBI adopts an information theoretic principle, information bottleneck principle, as a criterion for finding such explanations.;arxiv
7170;For each instance, VIBI selects key features that are maximally compressed about an input (briefness), and informative about a decision made by a black-box system on that input (comprehensive).;arxiv
7171;We evaluate VIBI on three datasets and compare with state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning methods in terms of both interpretability and fidelity evaluated by human and quantitative metrics;arxiv

7176;Denoising is a fundamental challenge in scientific imaging.;arxiv
7177;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the current state of the art in denoising natural images, where they produce impressive results.;arxiv
7178;However, their potential has barely been explored in the context of scientific imaging.;arxiv
7179;Denoising CNNs are typically trained on real natural images artificially corrupted with simulated noise.;arxiv
7180;In contrast, in scientific applications, noiseless ground-truth images are usually not available.;arxiv
7181;To address this issue, we propose a simulation-based denoising (SBD) framework, in which CNNs are trained on simulated images.;arxiv
7182;We test the framework on data obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an imaging technique with widespread applications in material science, biology, and medicine.;arxiv
7183;SBD outperforms existing techniques by a wide margin on a simulated benchmark dataset, as well as on real data.;arxiv
7184;Apart from the denoised images, SBD generates likelihood maps to visualize the agreement between the structure of the denoised image and the observed data.;arxiv
7185;Our results reveal shortcomings of state-of-the-art denoising architectures, such as their small field-of-view: substantially increasing the field-of-view of the CNNs allows them to exploit non-local periodic patterns in the data, which is crucial at high noise levels.;arxiv
7186;In addition, we analyze the generalization capability of SBD, demonstrating that the trained networks are robust to variations of imaging parameters and of the underlying signal structure.;arxiv
7187;Finally, we release the first publicly available benchmark dataset of TEM images, containing 18,000 examples.;arxiv

7193;Melanoma is considered to be the most aggressive form of skin cancer.;arxiv
7194;Due to the similar shape of malignant and benign cancerous lesions, doctors spend considerably more time when diagnosing these findings.;arxiv
7195;At present, the evaluation of malignancy is performed primarily by invasive histological examination of the suspicious lesion.;arxiv
7196;Developing an accurate classifier for early and efficient detection can minimize and monitor the harmful effects of skin cancer and increase patient survival rates.;arxiv
7197;This paper proposes a multi-class classification task using the CoAtNet architecture, a hybrid model that combines the depthwise convolution matrix operation of traditional convolutional neural networks with the strengths of Transformer models and self-attention mechanics to achieve better generalization and capacity.;arxiv
7198;The proposed multi-class classifier achieves an overall precision of 0.901, recall 0.895, and AP 0.923, indicating high performance compared to other state-of-the-art networks.;arxiv
7199;Simulation has the potential to transform the development of robust algorithms for mobile agents deployed in safety-critical scenarios.;arxiv
7200;However, the poor photorealism and lack of diverse sensor modalities of existing simulation engines remain key hurdles towards realizing this potential.;arxiv
7201;Here, we present VISTA, an open source, data-driven simulator that integrates multiple types of sensors for autonomous vehicles.;arxiv
7202;Using high fidelity, real-world datasets, VISTA represents and simulates RGB cameras, 3D LiDAR, and event-based cameras, enabling the rapid generation of novel viewpoints in simulation and thereby enriching the data available for policy learning with corner cases that are difficult to capture in the physical world.;arxiv
7203;Using VISTA, we demonstrate the ability to train and test perception-to-control policies across each of the sensor types and showcase the power of this approach via deployment on a full scale autonomous vehicle.;arxiv
7204;The policies learned in VISTA exhibit sim-to-real transfer without modification and greater robustness than those trained exclusively on real-world data.;arxiv
7205;Poor sitting habits have been identified as a risk factor to musculoskeletal disorders and lower back pain especially on the elderly, disabled people, and office workers.;arxiv
7206;In the current computerized world, even while involved in leisure or work activity, people tend to spend most of their days sitting at computer desks.;arxiv
7207;This can result in spinal pain and related problems.;arxiv
7208;Therefore, a means to remind people about their sitting habits and provide recommendations to counterbalance, such as physical exercise, is important.;arxiv
7209;Posture recognition for seated postures have not received enough attention as most works focus on standing postures.;arxiv
7210;Wearable sensors, pressure or force sensors, videos and images were used for posture recognition in the literature.;arxiv
7211;The aim of this study is to build Machine Learning models for classifying sitting posture of a person by analyzing data collected from a chair platted with two 32 by 32 pressure sensors at its seat and backrest.;arxiv
7212;"Models were built using five algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Na\""ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Deep Neural Network (DNN).";arxiv

7216;One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to minimize the computational expense of discovering state-of-the-art models.;arxiv
7217;However, in the past year attention has been drawn to the comparable performance of naive random search across the same search spaces used by leading NAS algorithms.;arxiv
7218;To address this, we explore the effects of drastically relaxing the NAS search space, and we present Bonsai-Net, an efficient one-shot NAS method to explore our relaxed search space.;arxiv
7219;Bonsai-Net is built around a modified differential pruner and can consistently discover state-of-the-art architectures that are significantly better than random search with fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art methods.;arxiv
7220;Additionally, Bonsai-Net performs simultaneous model search and training, dramatically reducing the total time it takes to generate fully-trained models from scratch.;arxiv
7221;Many important data analysis applications present with severely imbalanced datasets with respect to the target variable.;arxiv
7222;A typical example is medical image analysis, where positive samples are scarce, while performance is commonly estimated against the correct detection of these positive examples.;arxiv
7223;We approach this challenge by formulating the problem as anomaly detection with generative models.;arxiv
7224;In this position paper, we present the use of state-of-the-art deep generative models (GAN and VAE) for the estimation of a likelihood of the data.;arxiv
7225;On the other hand, for the NLST case, neither GANs nor VAEs were able to capture the complexity of the data and discriminate anomalies at the level that this task requires.;arxiv
7226;These results show that even though there are a number of successes presented in the literature for using generative models in similar applications, there remain further challenges for broad successful implementation.;arxiv
7227;We study networks of communicating learning agents that cooperate to solve a common nonstochastic bandit problem.;arxiv
7228;Agents use an underlying communication network to get messages about actions selected by other agents, and drop messages that took more than $d$ hops to arrive, where $d$ is a delay parameter.;arxiv
7229;We introduce \textsc{Exp3-Coop}, a cooperative version of the {\sc Exp3} algorithm and prove that with $K$ actions and $N$ agents the average per-agent regret after $T$ rounds is at most of order $\sqrt{\bigl(d+1 + \tfrac{K}{N}\alpha_{\le d}\bigr)(T\ln K)}$, where $\alpha_{\le d}$ is the independence number of the $d$-th power of the connected communication graph $G$.;arxiv
7230;We then show that for any connected graph, for $d=\sqrt{K}$ the regret bound is $K^{1/4}\sqrt{T}$, strictly better than the minimax regret $\sqrt{KT}$ for noncooperating agents.;arxiv
7231;More informed choices of $d$ lead to bounds which are arbitrarily close to the full information minimax regret $\sqrt{T\ln K}$ when $G$ is dense.;arxiv
7232;When $G$ has sparse components, we show that a variant of \textsc{Exp3-Coop}, allowing agents to choose their parameters according to their centrality in $G$, strictly improves the regret.;arxiv
7233;Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we provide the first characterization of the minimax regret for bandit learning with delay.;arxiv

7249;In this article, we first analyze the training unstablity problem and the mistaken confusion issue in adversarial learning process.;arxiv
7250;Then, inspired by domain confusion and self-ensembling methods, we propose a combined model to learn feature and class jointly invariant representation, namely Domain Confusion with Self Ensembling (DCSE).;arxiv
7251;The experiments verified that our proposed approach can offer better performance than empirical art in a variety of unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.;arxiv
7252;Deep generative modeling using flows has gained popularity owing to the tractable exact log-likelihood estimation with efficient training and synthesis process.;arxiv
7253;However, flow models suffer from the challenge of having high dimensional latent space, the same in dimension as the input space.;arxiv
7254;An effective solution to the above challenge as proposed by Dinh et al. (2016) is a multi-scale architecture, which is based on iterative early factorization of a part of the total dimensions at regular intervals.;arxiv
7255;Prior works on generative flow models involving a multi-scale architecture perform the dimension factorization based on static masking.;arxiv
7256;We propose a novel multi-scale architecture that performs data-dependent factorization to decide which dimensions should pass through more flow layers.;arxiv
7257;To facilitate the same, we introduce a heuristic based on the contribution of each dimension to the total log-likelihood which encodes the importance of the dimensions.;arxiv
7258;Our proposed heuristic is readily obtained as part of the flow training process, enabling the versatile implementation of our likelihood contribution based multi-scale architecture for generic flow models.;arxiv
7259;We present such implementations for several state-of-the-art flow models and demonstrate improvements in log-likelihood score and sampling quality on standard image benchmarks.;arxiv

7261;Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes.;arxiv
7262;These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers.;arxiv
7263;In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited.;arxiv
7264;The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities.;arxiv
7265;Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem.;arxiv

7270;ICD coding is the international standard for capturing and reporting health conditions and diagnosis for revenue cycle management in healthcare.;arxiv
7271;Manually assigning ICD codes is prone to human error due to the large code vocabulary and the similarities between codes.;arxiv
7272;Since machine learning based approaches require ground truth training data, the inconsistency among human coders is manifested as noise in labeling, which makes the training and evaluation of ICD classifiers difficult in presence of such noise.;arxiv
7273;This paper investigates the characteristics of such noise in manually-assigned ICD-10 codes and furthermore, proposes a method to train robust ICD-10 classifiers in the presence of labeling noise.;arxiv
7274;Our research concluded that the nature of such noise is systematic.;arxiv
7275;Most of the existing methods for handling label noise assume that the noise is completely random and independent of features or labels, which is not the case for ICD data.;arxiv
7276;Therefore, we develop a new method for training robust classifiers in the presence of systematic noise.;arxiv
7277;We compared our method with the baseline that does not handle label noise and the baseline methods that assume random noise, and demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms all baselines when evaluated on expert validated labels.;arxiv
7278;In this paper, we consider the problem of $\ell_{p}$ norm linear regression, which has several applications such as in sparse recovery, data clustering, and semi-supervised learning.;arxiv
7279;The problem, even though convex, does not enjoy a closed-form solution.;arxiv
7280;Subsequently, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be applied for the graph based semi-supervised learning problem.;arxiv
7281;We show through numerical simulations that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution for any random initialization and also performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of speed of convergence.;arxiv

7283;Analyzing the morphology of cells in microscopy images can provide insights into the mechanism of compounds or the function of genes.;arxiv
7284;We propose Treatment ExemplArs with Mixture-of-experts (TEAMs), an embedding learning approach that learns a set of experts that are specialized in capturing technical variations in our training set and then aggregates specialist's predictions at test time.;arxiv
7285;Thus, TEAMs can learn powerful embeddings with less technical variation bias by minimizing the noise from every expert.;arxiv

7293;The incredible effectiveness of adversarial attacks on fooling deep neural networks poses a tremendous hurdle in the widespread adoption of deep learning in safety and security-critical domains.;arxiv
7294;While adversarial defense mechanisms have been proposed since the discovery of the adversarial vulnerability issue of deep neural networks, there is a long path to fully understand and address this issue.;arxiv
7295;In this study, we hypothesize that part of the reason for the incredible effectiveness of adversarial attacks is their ability to implicitly tap into and exploit the gradient flow of a deep neural network.;arxiv
7296;This innate ability to exploit gradient flow makes defending against such attacks quite challenging.;arxiv
7297;Motivated by this hypothesis we argue that if a deep neural network architecture can explicitly tap into its own gradient flow during the training, it can boost its defense capability significantly.;arxiv
7298;Inspired by this fact, we introduce the concept of self-gradient networks, a novel deep neural network architecture designed to be more robust against adversarial perturbations.;arxiv
7299;Gradient flow information is leveraged within self-gradient networks to achieve greater perturbation stability beyond what can be achieved in the standard training process.;arxiv
7300;We conduct a theoretical analysis to gain better insights into the behaviour of the proposed self-gradient networks to illustrate the efficacy of leverage this additional gradient flow information.;arxiv
7301;The proposed self-gradient network architecture enables much more efficient and effective adversarial training, leading to faster convergence towards an adversarially robust solution by at least 10X. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-gradient networks when compared with state-of-the-art adversarial learning strategies, with 10% improvement on the CIFAR10 dataset under PGD and CW adversarial perturbations.;arxiv
7302;In this paper we consider the problem of clustering collections of very short texts using subspace clustering.;arxiv
7303;This problem arises in many applications such as product categorisation, fraud detection, and sentiment analysis.;arxiv
7304;The main challenge lies in the fact that the vectorial representation of short texts is both high-dimensional, due to the large number of unique terms in the corpus, and extremely sparse, as each text contains a very small number of words with no repetition.;arxiv
7305;We propose a new, simple subspace clustering algorithm that relies on linear algebra to cluster such datasets.;arxiv
7306;Experimental results on identifying product categories from product names obtained from the US Amazon website indicate that the algorithm can be competitive against state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.;arxiv

7308;Several recent attacks have been able to infer sensitive information from trained models, including model inversion or attribute inference attacks.;arxiv
7309;These attacks are able to reveal the values of certain sensitive features of individuals who participated in training the model.;arxiv
7310;It has also been shown that several factors can contribute to an increased risk of model inversion, including feature influence.;arxiv
7311;We observe that not all features necessarily share the same level of privacy or sensitivity.;arxiv
7312;In many cases, certain features used to train a model are considered especially sensitive and therefore propitious candidates for inversion.;arxiv
7313;We present a solution for countering model inversion attacks in tree-based models, by reducing the influence of sensitive features in these models.;arxiv
7314;This is an avenue that has not yet been thoroughly investigated, with only very nascent previous attempts at using this as a countermeasure against attribute inference.;arxiv
7315;Our work shows that, in many cases, it is possible to train a model in different ways, resulting in different influence levels of the various features, without necessarily harming the model's accuracy.;arxiv
7316;We are able to utilize this fact to train models in a manner that reduces the model's reliance on the most sensitive features, while increasing the importance of less sensitive features.;arxiv
7317;Our evaluation confirms that training models in this manner reduces the risk of inference for those features, as demonstrated through several black-box and white-box attacks.;arxiv

7327;ARLPCG instead deploys an adversarial model with one PCG RL agent (called Generator) and one solving RL agent (called Solver).;arxiv
7328;The Generator receives a reward signal based on the Solver's performance, which encourages the environment design to be challenging but not impossible.;arxiv
7329;To further drive diversity and control of the environment generation, we propose using auxiliary inputs for the Generator.;arxiv
7330;The benefit is two-fold: Firstly, the Solver achieves better generalization through the Generator's generated challenges.;arxiv
7331;Secondly, the trained Generator can be used as a creator of novel environments that, together with the Solver, can be shown to be solvable.;arxiv
7332;We create two types of 3D environments to validate our model, representing two popular game genres: a third-person platformer and a racing game.;arxiv

7335;Confidence scores that minimize standard metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) accurately measure the reliability on average across the entire population.;arxiv
7336;However, it is in general impossible to measure the reliability of an individual prediction.;arxiv
7337;In this work, we propose the local calibration error (LCE) to span the gap between average and individual reliability.;arxiv
7338;For each individual prediction, the LCE measures the average reliability of a set of similar predictions, where similarity is quantified by a kernel function on a pretrained feature space and by a binning scheme over predicted model confidences.;arxiv
7339;We show theoretically that the LCE can be estimated sample-efficiently from data, and empirically find that it reveals miscalibration modes that are more fine-grained than the ECE can detect.;arxiv

7354;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but suffer from training instability.;arxiv
7355;The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge.;arxiv
7356;We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior.;arxiv

7369;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received a great deal of attention due in part to recent success in generating original, high-quality samples from visual domains.;arxiv
7370;However, most current methods only allow for users to guide this image generation process through limited interactions.;arxiv
7371;"In this work we develop a novel GAN framework that allows humans to be ""in-the-loop"" of the image generation process.";arxiv
7372;"Our technique iteratively accepts relative constraints of the form ""Generate an image more like image A than image B"".";arxiv
7373;After each constraint is given, the user is presented with new outputs from the GAN, informing the next round of feedback.;arxiv
7374;In our experiments, we show that our GAN framework is able to generate images that are of comparable quality to equivalent unsupervised GANs while satisfying a large number of the constraints provided by users, effectively changing a GAN into one that allows users interactive control over image generation without sacrificing image quality.;arxiv
7375;Using a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, model-based methods have recently achieved much higher sample efficiency than previous model-free methods for continuous-action DRL benchmarks.;arxiv
7376;In this paper, we introduce a simple model-free algorithm, Randomized Ensembled Double Q-Learning (REDQ), and show that its performance is just as good as, if not better than, a state-of-the-art model-based algorithm for the MuJoCo benchmark.;arxiv

7379;Machine learning (ML) has developed rapidly in the past few years and has successfully been utilized for a broad range of tasks, including phishing detection.;arxiv
7380;However, building an effective ML-based detection system is not a trivial task, and requires data scientists with knowledge of the relevant domain.;arxiv
7381;Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks have received a lot of attention in recent years, enabling non-ML experts in building a machine learning model.;arxiv
7382;This brings to an intriguing question of whether AutoML can outperform the results achieved by human data scientists.;arxiv
7383;Our paper compares the performances of six well-known, state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks on ten different phishing datasets to see whether AutoML-based models can outperform manually crafted machine learning models.;arxiv
7384;Our results indicate that AutoML-based models are able to outperform manually developed machine learning models in complex classification tasks, specifically in datasets where the features are not quite discriminative, and datasets with overlapping classes or relatively high degrees of non-linearity.;arxiv
7385;Challenges also remain in building a real-world phishing detection system using AutoML frameworks due to the current support only on supervised classification problems, leading to the need for labeled data, and the inability to update the AutoML-based models incrementally.;arxiv
7386;This indicates that experts with knowledge in the domain of phishing and cybersecurity are still essential in the loop of the phishing detection pipeline.;arxiv
7387;We investigate the problem of recovering a partially observed high-rank matrix whose columns obey a nonlinear structure such as a union of subspaces, an algebraic variety or grouped in clusters.;arxiv
7388;The recovery problem is formulated as the rank minimization of a nonlinear feature map applied to the original matrix, which is then further approximated by a constrained non-convex optimization problem involving the Grassmann manifold.;arxiv
7389;We propose two sets of algorithms, one arising from Riemannian optimization and the other as an alternating minimization scheme, both of which include first- and second-order variants.;arxiv
7390;In particular, for the alternating minimization, we establish global convergence and worst-case complexity bounds.;arxiv
7391;Additionally, using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, we show that the alternating minimization converges to a unique limit point.;arxiv
7392;We provide extensive numerical results for the recovery of union of subspaces and clustering under entry sampling and dense Gaussian sampling.;arxiv
7393;Our methods are competitive with existing approaches and, in particular, high accuracy is achieved in the recovery using Riemannian second-order methods.;arxiv
7394;We give an algorithm for completing an order-$m$ symmetric low-rank tensor from its multilinear entries in time roughly proportional to the number of tensor entries.;arxiv
7395;We apply our tensor completion algorithm to the problem of learning mixtures of product distributions over the hypercube, obtaining new algorithmic results.;arxiv
7396;If the centers of the product distribution are linearly independent, then we recover distributions with as many as $\Omega(n)$ centers in polynomial time and sample complexity.;arxiv
7397;In the general case, we recover distributions with as many as $\tilde\Omega(n)$ centers in quasi-polynomial time, answering an open problem of Feldman et al.;arxiv
7398;for the special case of distributions with incoherent bias vectors.;arxiv
7399;Our main algorithmic tool is the iterated application of a low-rank matrix completion algorithm for matrices with adversarially missing entries.;arxiv
7400;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as aerial base-stations to relay time-sensitive packets from IoT devices to the nearby terrestrial base-station (TBS).;arxiv
7401;To address this, we propose Age-of-Information (AoI) scheduling algorithms for two-hop UAV-relayed IoT-networks.;arxiv
7402;First, we propose a low-complexity AoI scheduler, termed, MAF-MAD that employs Maximum AoI First (MAF) policy for sampling of IoT devices at UAV (hop-1) and Maximum AoI Difference (MAD) policy for updating sampled packets from UAV to the TBS (hop-2).;arxiv
7403;We prove that MAF-MAD is the optimal AoI scheduler under ideal conditions (lossless wireless channels and generate-at-will traffic-generation at IoT devices).;arxiv
7404;On the contrary, for general conditions (lossy channel conditions and varying periodic traffic-generation at IoT devices), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, namely, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based scheduler is proposed.;arxiv
7405;Simulation results show that the proposed PPO-based scheduler outperforms other schedulers like MAF-MAD, MAF, and round-robin in all considered general scenarios.;arxiv
7406;Deep Learning as a field has been successfully used to solve a plethora of complex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades back.;arxiv
7407;But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can be used to bring harm to our society.;arxiv
7408;Deep fakes have been proven to be one such problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake image or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be some countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake or real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online information.;arxiv
7409;Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be as real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal traces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible to a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to specialize in Deep fake detection.;arxiv
7410;In this paper, we analyze several such states of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception Net) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for various scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online social media platforms where the classification should be made as fast as possible or for a small news agency where the classification need not be in real-time but requires utmost accuracy.;arxiv
7411;The proper initialization of weights is crucial for the effective training and fast convergence of deep neural networks (DNNs).;arxiv
7412;Prior work in this area has mostly focused on balancing the variance among weights per layer to maintain stability of (i) the input data propagated forwards through the network and (ii) the loss gradients propagated backwards, respectively.;arxiv
7413;This prevalent heuristic is however agnostic of dependencies among gradients across the various layers and captures only firstorder effects.;arxiv
7414;In this paper, we propose and discuss an initialization principle that is based on a rigorous estimation of the global curvature of weights across layers by approximating and controlling the norm of their Hessian matrix.;arxiv
7415;The proposed approach is more systematic and recovers previous results for DNN activations such as smooth functions, dropouts, and ReLU.;arxiv
7416;Our experiments on Word2Vec and the MNIST/CIFAR image classification tasks confirm that tracking the Hessian norm is a useful diagnostic tool which helps to more rigorously initialize weights;arxiv
7417;While different methods exist to tackle distinct types of distribution shift, such as label shift (in the form of adversarial attacks) or domain shift, tackling the joint shift setting is still an open problem.;arxiv
7418;Through the study of a joint distribution shift manifesting both adversarial and domain-specific perturbations, we not only show that a joint shift worsens model performance compared to their individual shifts, but that the use of a similar domain worsens performance than a dissimilar domain.;arxiv
7419;To curb the performance drop, we study the use of perturbation sets motivated by input and parameter space bounds, and adopt a meta learning strategy (hypernetworks) to model parameters w.r.t.;arxiv
7420;A key aspect of human intelligence is their ability to convey their knowledge to others in succinct forms.;arxiv
7421;However, despite their predictive power, current machine learning models are largely blackboxes, making it difficult for humans to extract useful insights.;arxiv
7422;"Focusing on sequential decision-making, we design a novel machine learning algorithm that conveys its insights to humans in the form of interpretable ""tips"".";arxiv
7423;Our algorithm selects the tip that best bridges the gap in performance between human users and the optimal policy.;arxiv
7424;We evaluate our approach through a series of randomized controlled user studies where participants manage a virtual kitchen.;arxiv
7425;Our experiments show that the tips generated by our algorithm can significantly improve human performance relative to intuitive baselines.;arxiv
7426;In addition, we discuss a number of empirical insights that can help inform the design of algorithms intended for human-AI interfaces.;arxiv
7427;An important problem in deep learning is the privacy and security of neural networks (NNs).;arxiv
7428;To date, it is still poorly understood how privacy enhancing training affects the robustness of NNs.;arxiv
7429;This paper experimentally evaluates the impact of training with Differential Privacy (DP), a standard method for privacy preservation, on model vulnerability against a broad range of adversarial attacks.;arxiv
7430;The results suggest that private models are less robust than their non-private counterparts, and that adversarial examples transfer better among DP models than between non-private and private ones.;arxiv
7431;Furthermore, detailed analyses of DP and non-DP models suggest significant differences between their gradients.;arxiv
7432;Additionally, this work is the first to observe that an unfavorable choice of parameters in DP training can lead to gradient masking, and, thereby, results in a wrong sense of security.;arxiv
7433;Society has come to rely on algorithms like classifiers for important decision making, giving rise to the need for ethical guarantees such as fairness.;arxiv
7434;Fairness is typically defined by asking that some statistic of a classifier be approximately equal over protected groups within a population.;arxiv
7435;In this paper, current approaches to fairness are discussed and used to motivate algorithmic proposals that incorporate fairness into genetic programming for classification.;arxiv
7436;The first is to incorporate a fairness objective into multi-objective optimization.;arxiv
7437;The second is to adapt lexicase selection to define cases dynamically over intersections of protected groups.;arxiv
7438;We describe why lexicase selection is well suited to pressure models to perform well across the potentially infinitely many subgroups over which fairness is desired.;arxiv
7439;We use a recent genetic programming approach to construct models on four datasets for which fairness constraints are necessary, and empirically compare performance to prior methods utilizing game-theoretic solutions.;arxiv
7440;Methods are assessed based on their ability to generate trade-offs of subgroup fairness and accuracy that are Pareto optimal.;arxiv
7441;The result show that genetic programming methods in general, and random search in particular, are well suited to this task.;arxiv
7442;We explore the idea that authoring a piece of text is an act of maximizing one's expected utility.;arxiv
7443;To make this idea concrete, we consider the societally important decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.;arxiv
7444;Extensive past work in quantitative political science provides a framework for empirically modeling the decisions of justices and how they relate to text.;arxiv
7445;"We incorporate into such a model texts authored by amici curiae (""friends of the court"" separate from the litigants) who seek to weigh in on the decision, then explicitly model their goals in a random utility model.";arxiv
7446;We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in improved vote prediction and the ability to perform counterfactual analysis.;arxiv
7447;Pathologist-defined labels are the gold standard for histopathological data sets, regardless of well-known limitations in consistency for some tasks.;arxiv
7448;To date, some datasets on mitotic figures are available and were used for development of promising deep learning-based algorithms.;arxiv
7449;In order to assess robustness of those algorithms and reproducibility of their methods it is necessary to test on several independent datasets.;arxiv
7450;The influence of different labeling methods of these available datasets is currently unknown.;arxiv
7451;To tackle this, we present an alternative set of labels for the images of the auxiliary mitosis dataset of the TUPAC16 challenge.;arxiv
7452;Additional to manual mitotic figure screening, we used a novel, algorithm-aided labeling process, that allowed to minimize the risk of missing rare mitotic figures in the images.;arxiv
7453;All potential mitotic figures were independently assessed by two pathologists.;arxiv
7454;The novel, publicly available set of labels contains 1,999 mitotic figures (+28.80%) and additionally includes 10,483 labels of cells with high similarities to mitotic figures (hard examples).;arxiv
7455;We found significant difference comparing F_1 scores between the original label set (0.549) and the new alternative label set (0.735) using a standard deep learning object detection architecture.;arxiv
7456;The models trained on the alternative set showed higher overall confidence values, suggesting a higher overall label consistency.;arxiv
7457;Findings of the present study show that pathologists-defined labels may vary significantly resulting in notable difference in the model performance.;arxiv
7458;Comparison of deep learning-based algorithms between independent datasets with different labeling methods should be done with caution.;arxiv
7459;Learning properties of large graphs from samples has been an important problem in statistical network analysis since the early work of Goodman \cite{Goodman1949} and Frank \cite{Frank1978}.;arxiv
7460;We revisit a problem formulated by Frank \cite{Frank1978} of estimating the number of connected components in a large graph based on the subgraph sampling model, in which we randomly sample a subset of the vertices and observe the induced subgraph.;arxiv
7461;The key question is whether accurate estimation is achievable in the \emph{sublinear} regime where only a vanishing fraction of the vertices are sampled.;arxiv
7462;We show that it is impossible if the parent graph is allowed to contain high-degree vertices or long induced cycles.;arxiv
7463;For the class of chordal graphs, where induced cycles of length four or above are forbidden, we characterize the optimal sample complexity within constant factors and construct linear-time estimators that provably achieve these bounds.;arxiv
7464;This significantly expands the scope of previous results which have focused on unbiased estimators and special classes of graphs such as forests or cliques.;arxiv
7465;Both the construction and the analysis of the proposed methodology rely on combinatorial properties of chordal graphs and identities of induced subgraph counts.;arxiv
7466;They, in turn, also play a key role in proving minimax lower bounds based on construction of random instances of graphs with matching structures of small subgraphs.;arxiv
7467;Automatic speech recognition systems usually rely on spectral-based features, such as MFCC of PLP.;arxiv
7468;These features are extracted based on prior knowledge such as, speech perception or/and speech production.;arxiv
7469;This system was shown to yield similar or better performance than HMM/ANN based system on phoneme recognition task and on large scale continuous speech recognition task, using less parameters.;arxiv
7470;Motivated by these studies, we investigate the use of simple linear classifier in the CNN-based framework.;arxiv
7471;Thus, the network learns linearly separable features from raw speech.;arxiv
7472;We show that such system yields similar or better performance than MLP based system using cepstral-based features as input.;arxiv
7473;Computing approximate nearest neighbors in high dimensional spaces is a central problem in large-scale data mining with a wide range of applications in machine learning and data science.;arxiv
7474;In this paper, we aim to develop LSH schemes for distance functions that measure the distance between two probability distributions, particularly for f-divergences as well as a generalization to capture mutual information loss.;arxiv
7475;First, we provide a general framework to design LHS schemes for f-divergence distance functions and develop LSH schemes for the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence and triangular discrimination in this framework.;arxiv
7476;We show a two-sided approximation result for approximation of the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence by the Hellinger distance, which may be of independent interest.;arxiv
7477;Next, we show a general method of reducing the problem of designing an LSH scheme for a Krein kernel (which can be expressed as the difference of two positive definite kernels) to the problem of maximum inner product search.;arxiv
7478;We exemplify this method by applying it to the mutual information loss, due to its several important applications such as model compression.;arxiv
7479;Representation learning for knowledge graphs (KGs) has focused on the problem of answering simple link prediction queries.;arxiv
7480;In this work we address the more ambitious challenge of predicting the answers of conjunctive queries with multiple missing entities.;arxiv
7481;We propose Bi-Directional Query Embedding (BIQE), a method that embeds conjunctive queries with models based on bi-directional attention mechanisms.;arxiv
7482;Contrary to prior work, bidirectional self-attention can capture interactions among all the elements of a query graph.;arxiv
7483;We introduce a new dataset for predicting the answer of conjunctive query and conduct experiments that show BIQE significantly outperforming state of the art baselines.;arxiv
7484;The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference.;arxiv
7485;Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations.;arxiv
7486;This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods.;arxiv
7487;We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions.;arxiv
7488;Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained.;arxiv
7489;We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations.;arxiv
7490;We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.;arxiv
7491;Policy gradient methods are a widely used class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms where a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient estimator variance.;arxiv
7492;Several recent papers extend the baseline to depend on both the state and action and suggest that this significantly reduces variance and improves sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates.;arxiv
7493;To better understand this development, we decompose the variance of the policy gradient estimator and numerically show that learned state-action-dependent baselines do not in fact reduce variance over a state-dependent baseline in commonly tested benchmark domains.;arxiv
7494;We confirm this unexpected result by reviewing the open-source code accompanying these prior papers, and show that subtle implementation decisions cause deviations from the methods presented in the papers and explain the source of the previously observed empirical gains.;arxiv
7495;Furthermore, the variance decomposition highlights areas for improvement, which we demonstrate by illustrating a simple change to the typical value function parameterization that can significantly improve performance.;arxiv
7496;While computer vision has received increasing attention in computer science over the last decade, there are few efforts in applying this to leverage engineering design research.;arxiv
7497;Existing datasets and technologies allow researchers to capture and access more observations and video files, hence analysis is becoming a limiting factor.;arxiv
7498;Therefore, this paper is investigating the application of machine learning, namely object detection methods to aid in the analysis of physical porotypes.;arxiv
7499;With access to a large dataset of digitally captured physical prototypes from early-stage development projects (5950 images from 850 prototypes), the authors investigate applications that can be used for analysing this dataset.;arxiv
